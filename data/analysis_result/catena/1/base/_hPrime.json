            "content": "analysis_complete: The analysis correctly identifies the `_hPrime` configuration as performance-sensitive due to its critical role in cryptographic operations within the `flap` method. The justification highlights that the performance impact arises from the time-intensive nature of hashing processes, particularly as the number of iterations increases with larger inputs. This thorough understanding of how `_hPrime` affects overall system performance through its interactions with multiple components reinforces the conclusion, ensuring that all relevant aspects of performance sensitivity are addressed accurately."
