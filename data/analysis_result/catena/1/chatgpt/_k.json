    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_k' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because variations in its value can lead to significant changes in execution time and memory consumption. For instance, if '_k' controls a critical parameter such as the number of threads, buffer sizes, or algorithmic thresholds, altering its value could directly impact resource allocation and processing efficiency. This can result in increased latency or reduced throughput, thereby affecting overall system performance. Therefore, careful tuning of this configuration is essential for optimizing performance."
