    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes to its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and resource utilization. Specifically, if '_gHigh' controls aspects such as processing frequency, resource allocation, or optimization levels, even minor adjustments can drastically affect the system's throughput and latency. For instance, setting '_gHigh' to a value that increases resource allocation may enhance performance under load, while a lower value could lead to bottlenecks, increased response times, and higher memory consumption. Therefore, careful tuning of this configuration is essential for optimal system performance."
