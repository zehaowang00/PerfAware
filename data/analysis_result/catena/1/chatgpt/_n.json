    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_n' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes to its value can significantly influence the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Specifically, if '_n' controls aspects such as the number of threads, buffer sizes, or resource allocation, even a minor adjustment could lead to substantial variations in how efficiently the system utilizes resources, thereby affecting overall performance metrics. For instance, increasing '_n' might lead to improved throughput but could also result in higher memory usage, while decreasing it could reduce resource contention but might slow down processing times. Such trade-offs indicate that this configuration is critical for optimizing performance."
