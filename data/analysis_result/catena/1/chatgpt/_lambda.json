    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_lambda' configuration in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the execution model of the system. Changes in its value can lead to significant variations in the execution time of functions, especially in a serverless architecture where the lambda function's concurrency and resource allocation can affect response times and throughput. Additionally, adjustments to this configuration can impact memory consumption, as different lambda settings may require varying amounts of memory for execution, leading to potential bottlenecks or resource underutilization. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
