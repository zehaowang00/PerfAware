Without additional context on the implementation of `get_phi()` and the method it calls, it is not possible to ascertain any significant performance impact. The current implementation does not indicate any time-intensive or memory-intensive operations directly within the `phi` method itself, and thus it does not qualify as performance-sensitive."
