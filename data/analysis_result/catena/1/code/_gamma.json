Without additional context on the implementation of `get_gamma()` and its `gamma` method, it is unclear if they perform any time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. However, the provided code does not indicate any direct performance-sensitive operations, such as heavy computations or large memory allocations, that would significantly impact system performance. Thus, it cannot be classified as performance-sensitive based solely on the given information."
