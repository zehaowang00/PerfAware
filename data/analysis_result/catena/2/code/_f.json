Without additional context on the implementation of `graph`, it is unclear if it performs time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The provided code does not indicate any substantial performance impact, as it merely passes parameters to another method without any complex logic or resource-heavy operations. Therefore, it does not qualify as performance-sensitive based on the given criteria."
