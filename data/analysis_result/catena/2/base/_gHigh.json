This is essential for ensuring that the hashing functions can adapt to different security requirements based on the desired strength of the hash.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Methods Utilizing `_gHigh`**:\n  - **`catena`**: This method uses `_gHigh` in conjunction with `_gLow` to determine the range of iterations for hashing the password.\n  - **`keyedPasswordHashing`**: Retrieves the value of `_gHigh` to create a byte array that is part of the hashing process.\n  - **`keyDerivation`**: Similar to `catena`, it utilizes `_gHigh` to control the iteration range for generating derived keys.\n  - **`serverReliefClient`**: Checks the relationship between `_gHigh` and `_gLow` to manage the hashing process effectively.\n  - **`serverReliefServer`**: Uses `_gHigh` to create a byte array based on the last hash received, ensuring consistency in the hashing process.\n  - **`proofOfWorkServer`**: Sets the `gHigh` value in the output structure, which is relevant for the proof of work calculations.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `_gHigh` configuration interacts closely with other parameters, particularly `_gLow`, to define the operational bounds for various hashing algorithms. This interaction is crucial for maintaining a balance between security and efficiency in the hashing process. The methods that utilize `_gHigh` are interconnected, as they rely on this configuration to determine how many iterations to perform, thus affecting the overall behavior of the system's cryptographic functions.\n\nIn summary, the `_gHigh` configuration is a vital component that influences the hashing mechanisms within the system, ensuring that they operate within defined limits to meet security requirements."
