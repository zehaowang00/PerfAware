Here\u2019s a detailed overview of its purpose and interactions:\n\n1. **Purpose of `_k`**:\n   - The `_k` parameter defines the size of the byte arrays used in various computations within the methods. It essentially determines how much data is processed at each step of the hashing and transformation operations.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - In the `flap` method, `_k` is used to initialize the two-dimensional array `v`, which stores intermediate hashed values. The size of this array is dependent on the number of iterations calculated from the parameter `g`, specifically `iterations + 2`, where each entry in the array has a length of `_k`.\n   - In the `hInit` method, `_k` is involved in calculating the variable `l`, which dictates the number of hashed values to be generated. This is done by the formula `2 * this.get_k() / this.get_n()`, indicating that `_k` directly influences the number of iterations performed in this initialization process.\n\n3. **Dependencies**:\n   - The value of `_k` is critical as it interacts with other configuration parameters such as `_n` and indirectly influences the behavior of methods like `gamma`, `f`, and `phi`, which are called in the `flap` method. The effectiveness of these methods in processing data relies on the size of the arrays defined by `_k`.\n\n4. **Interactions with Other Components**:\n   - The `_k` parameter is accessed through the method `get_k()`, which suggests that it may be derived from a broader configuration context or set of parameters within the system. This makes it essential for understanding how data flows through the hashing and transformation processes.\n   - The methods `get_h()` and `get_hPrime()` also interact with `_k` indirectly, as they are responsible for hashing operations that utilize the byte arrays sized by `_k`.\n\nIn summary, the configuration `_k` is a fundamental component that dictates the size of data structures used in hashing operations, thus influencing the overall functionality of the methods that rely on it. Understanding `_k` and its interactions with other parameters is essential for grasping how the system processes data."

Here\\u2019s a detailed overview of its purpose and interactions:\\n\\n1. **Purpose of `_k`**:\\n   - The `_k` parameter defines the size of the byte arrays used in various computations within the methods. It essentially determines how much data is processed at each step of the hashing and transformation operations.\\n\\n2. **Functionality**:\\n   - In the `flap` method, `_k` is used to initialize the two-dimensional array `v`, which stores intermediate hashed values. The size of this array is dependent on the number of iterations calculated from the parameter `g`, specifically `iterations + 2`, where each entry in the array has a length of `_k`.\\n   - In the `hInit` method, `_k` is involved in calculating the variable `l`, which dictates the number of hashed values to be generated. This is done by the formula `2 * this.get_k() / this.get_n()`, indicating that `_k` directly influences the number of iterations performed in this initialization process.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The value of `_k` is critical as it interacts with other configuration parameters such as `_n` and indirectly influences the behavior of methods like `gamma`, `f`, and `phi`, which are called in the `flap` method. The effectiveness of these methods in processing data relies on the size of the arrays defined by `_k`.\\n\\n4. **Interactions with Other Components**:\\n   - The `_k` parameter is accessed through the method `get_k()`, which suggests that it may be derived from a broader configuration context or set of parameters within the system. This makes it essential for understanding how data flows through the hashing and transformation processes.\\n   - The methods `get_h()` and `get_hPrime()` also interact with `_k` indirectly, as they are responsible for hashing operations that utilize the byte arrays sized by `_k`.\\n\\nIn summary, the configuration `_k` is a fundamental component that dictates the size of data structures used in hashing operations, thus influencing the overall functionality of the methods that rely on it. Understanding `_k` and its interactions with other parameters is essential for grasping how the system processes data.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
