    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the resource allocation and processing thresholds within the system. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly under high-load scenarios. For instance, setting '_gLow' to a lower value may reduce the system's ability to handle concurrent processes efficiently, resulting in increased latency and decreased throughput. Conversely, a higher value may optimize resource usage, enhancing performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
