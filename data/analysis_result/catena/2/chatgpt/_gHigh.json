    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' in the 'catena' software project is considered performance-sensitive because changes to its value can lead to significant variations in resource allocation and processing efficiency. Specifically, adjusting this configuration could impact the execution time of critical algorithms or increase memory consumption, thereby affecting overall system throughput and responsiveness. Such variations can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially under high load conditions, making it crucial to monitor and optimize this setting for optimal system performance."
