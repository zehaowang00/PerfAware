    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the algorithm's execution efficiency. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in computationally intensive tasks where the optimization level affects the overall throughput. Additionally, variations in memory consumption can occur, impacting system resource allocation and potentially leading to increased garbage collection or memory swapping, which further degrades performance."
