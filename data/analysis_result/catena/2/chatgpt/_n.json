{
    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_n' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption. For instance, if '_n' controls the number of concurrent threads or the size of data buffers, increasing its value may enhance throughput but could also lead to increased contention for resources, resulting in longer execution times. Conversely, decreasing its value may reduce resource usage but could lead to underutilization of system capabilities, negatively impacting performance. Therefore, the sensitivity of this configuration option directly affects the overall system performance."
