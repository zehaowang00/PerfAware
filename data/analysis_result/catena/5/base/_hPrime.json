Its primary purpose is to facilitate the hashing process by providing a streamlined version of the main hash function, which is denoted as `h`.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n\n- **Hash Functions**:\n  - `_hPrime` is initialized through the `init` method, where it is set to the provided `hPrime` parameter. This establishes its role as a reduced hash function that works in conjunction with the main hash function (`h`).\n\n- **Gamma Function**:\n  - The `_gamma` component depends on `_hPrime` as it is configured to utilize this reduced hash function via the `setHPrime` method. This relationship indicates that the gamma function's operations may rely on the properties and output of `_hPrime`.\n\n- **Graph Configuration**:\n  - The graph component (`_f`) also interacts with `_hPrime`, as it is similarly set to use the reduced hash function through the `setHPrime` method. This suggests that the graph's structure and behavior may be influenced by the hashing mechanism provided by `_hPrime`.\n\n- **Phi Function**:\n  - The `_phi` function is another component that is configured to use `_hPrime`. This indicates that the phi function's operations are likely tied to the hashing process, further emphasizing the importance of `_hPrime` in the overall algorithm.\n\n- **Output Size**:\n  - The output size of `_hPrime` is stored in the variable `_k`, which is derived from calling `getOutputSize()` on `_hPrime`. This output size is crucial for determining the dimensions of various data structures and operations within the algorithm.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n\nThe `_hPrime` configuration interacts closely with multiple components of the Catena algorithm, including the gamma function, graph structure, and phi function. By providing a reduced hashing mechanism, it plays a vital role in ensuring that these components can perform their respective operations efficiently and effectively.
