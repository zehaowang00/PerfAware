Its primary purpose is to define the maximum value for the variable `g`, which is utilized in several methods to control the number of iterations during processing.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Methods Utilizing `_gHigh`:**\n  - **`catena` Method:** This method iterates from the lower bound (`gLow`) to `_gHigh`, determining how many times to process the password hashing. The range defined by `_gHigh` directly influences the complexity and depth of the hashing operation.\n  - **`keyedPasswordHashing` Method:** Here, `_gHigh` is used to create a byte array that is integral to the hashing process, combining it with other inputs like the key and user ID.\n  - **`serverReliefClient` Method:** Similar to `catena`, this method checks the relationship between `gLow` and `_gHigh` to decide how many iterations to perform. It also uses `_gHigh` in the final processing step to adjust the output.\n  - **`serverReliefServer` Method:** In this method, `_gHigh` is utilized to update the hash based on the last computed value, ensuring that the latest configuration is reflected in the output.\n  - **`proofOfWorkServer` Method:** This method captures `_gHigh` in its output structure, indicating its role in the overall processing logic.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `_gHigh` configuration interacts closely with its counterpart, `gLow`, to establish a range for `g`. This range is pivotal for controlling the flow of operations in various hashing methods. By defining the limits of `g`, `_gHigh` ensures that the system can handle password processing securely and effectively, adapting to different requirements based on the configuration values.\n\nIn summary, `_gHigh` is a fundamental configuration parameter that influences the operational behavior of multiple methods within the system, ensuring that password hashing and related processes are executed within defined bounds for security and functionality."
