Its main purpose is to update the hash array based on the provided salt (gamma) and the integer input.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method calls `this.get_gamma().gamma(g, x, gamma)`, indicating a dependency on another component or service that provides the `gamma` method. This suggests that the actual logic for updating the hash array is encapsulated within the `get_gamma()` method, which likely returns an instance of a class responsible for gamma-related operations.\n- The method returns a modified version of the hash array, which implies that it processes the input data and applies transformations based on the salt and the provided parameters.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The configuration relies on the `get_gamma()` method, which is expected to return an object that contains the `gamma` method. This indicates a modular design where the gamma processing logic is separated from the calling method, promoting reusability and maintainability.\n- The parameters `g`, `x`, and `gamma` are critical inputs that influence the behavior of the gamma processing, making them essential for the method's operation.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `gamma` method acts as a bridge between the input parameters and the underlying gamma processing logic.
