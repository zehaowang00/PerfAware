Without additional context on the complexity and resource usage of `get_f().graph(g, x, lambda)`, it cannot be determined that this configuration leads to significant performance variations. The operation appears to be a straightforward function call, which typically does not introduce substantial performance overhead unless the called method is known to be time or memory-intensive."
