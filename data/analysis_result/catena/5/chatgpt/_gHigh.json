    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the resource allocation and execution pathways of the application. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time, as it may alter the frequency of high-priority processes or the allocation of memory resources. This can result in increased latency or reduced throughput, particularly under load, thereby impacting overall system performance. Such sensitivity necessitates careful tuning and monitoring to optimize performance outcomes."
