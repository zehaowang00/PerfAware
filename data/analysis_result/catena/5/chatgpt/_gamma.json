    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gamma' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the algorithm's computational complexity and resource allocation. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time due to altered processing paths or increased/decreased memory usage. For instance, if '_gamma' controls a threshold for resource allocation, adjusting it could either optimize or degrade performance, resulting in notable impacts on system responsiveness and throughput."
