    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_lambda' configuration in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the execution of lambda functions, which are critical for processing data in a timely manner. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially under varying loads or data sizes. Additionally, if the configuration affects the allocation of resources or the optimization of function execution, it can lead to increased memory consumption or CPU usage, further impacting overall system performance."
