    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_k' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because its value directly influences key algorithmic parameters that govern execution paths and resource allocation. Changes in '_k' can lead to significant variations in execution time due to altered computational complexity or increased memory consumption as the system may need to handle larger data structures or more intensive processing tasks. This sensitivity is critical in performance-critical applications where even minor adjustments can result in substantial performance degradation or improvement."
