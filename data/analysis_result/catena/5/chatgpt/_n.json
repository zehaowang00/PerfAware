    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_n' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption. This option likely controls a critical parameter that directly influences resource allocation or algorithmic behavior, thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the system. For instance, if '_n' pertains to the number of threads or buffer sizes, increasing or decreasing this value can result in either underutilization or overutilization of system resources, leading to performance degradation or improvement. Therefore, careful tuning of this configuration is essential for optimizing system performance."
