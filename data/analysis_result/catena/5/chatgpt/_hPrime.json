    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' in the 'catena' software project is considered performance-sensitive because changes to its value can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Specifically, if '_hPrime' controls aspects such as the hashing algorithm's parameters or the size of internal data structures, even minor adjustments can lead to substantial variations in computational efficiency and resource utilization. This sensitivity is critical in performance-critical applications where latency and throughput are paramount, making it essential to carefully tune this configuration for optimal system performance."
