    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because its value directly influences the system's resource allocation and processing efficiency. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly under load conditions. For instance, setting '_gLow' to a lower value may reduce the granularity of resource management, resulting in increased contention for CPU cycles and memory, ultimately degrading overall system performance. Conversely, a higher value may optimize resource usage, leading to improved throughput and reduced latency. Therefore, the sensitivity of this configuration to performance metrics makes it critical for system tuning and optimization."
