    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_lambda' configuration in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the execution model of the system. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in how functions are executed, impacting both execution time and resource utilization. For instance, a lower lambda value may result in faster execution but could increase memory consumption due to more frequent invocations, while a higher lambda value could reduce memory usage but lead to longer execution times due to fewer invocations. This trade-off indicates that adjustments to the '_lambda' configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
