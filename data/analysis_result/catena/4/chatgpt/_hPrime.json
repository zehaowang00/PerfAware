    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the algorithm's execution path and memory allocation strategies. Changes in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time due to alterations in computational complexity and resource utilization. For instance, if '_hPrime' is set to a higher value, it may increase the number of iterations in a loop or the size of data structures, resulting in increased memory consumption and longer processing times. Conversely, a lower value may optimize performance by reducing resource usage, thus affecting overall system throughput and responsiveness."
