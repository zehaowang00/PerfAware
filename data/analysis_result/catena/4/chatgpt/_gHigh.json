    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes to its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and resource utilization. Specifically, if '_gHigh' controls aspects such as the granularity of processing or the level of detail in data handling, increasing its value may lead to more intensive computations or larger memory allocations, thereby increasing latency and overall system load. Conversely, reducing its value could optimize performance by decreasing resource consumption, thus affecting throughput and responsiveness. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration directly impact the system's performance metrics."
