Given that cryptographic functions often require significant processing power and memory, especially when dealing with hash inputs and outputs, this configuration can lead to substantial performance impacts in terms of time and memory usage. The reliance on a two-dimensional byte array as input further suggests that the method could be handling large datasets, which can exacerbate performance concerns."
