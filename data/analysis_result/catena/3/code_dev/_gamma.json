This indicates a dependency on the `get_gamma()` method, which is crucial for executing the gamma update logic.\n\nThe primary output of the `gamma` method is a modified hash array, which suggests that this configuration plays a critical role in data transformation or encryption processes within the system.

Without explicit information on whether this operation involves time-intensive computations or memory-heavy processes, it cannot be classified as performance-sensitive.
