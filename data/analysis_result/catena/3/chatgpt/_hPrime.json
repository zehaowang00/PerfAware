    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the algorithm's execution path and the amount of computational resources required. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in execution time, particularly in scenarios where the algorithm's complexity scales with the input size. Additionally, altering this configuration can impact memory consumption, as different values may require varying amounts of data to be held in memory during processing. This sensitivity to changes can result in noticeable performance degradation or improvement, making it crucial to monitor and optimize this configuration for optimal system performance."
