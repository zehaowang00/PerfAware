    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_lambda' configuration in the 'catena' software project directly influences the execution time of functions that rely on lambda expressions. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in how resources are allocated and utilized during runtime, affecting both execution speed and memory consumption. For instance, a higher lambda value may increase the overhead of function calls, leading to longer execution times, while a lower value could reduce resource usage but may also limit functionality. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
