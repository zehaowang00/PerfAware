    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because changes to its value can lead to significant variations in execution time and resource utilization. Specifically, altering this configuration may affect the granularity of processing or the level of detail in data handling, which can directly impact the system's throughput and latency. As a result, even minor adjustments to '_gHigh' can result in noticeable differences in performance metrics, making it a critical parameter for optimizing system performance."
