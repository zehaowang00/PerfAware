    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option '_vId' in the 'catena' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system identifies and manages various components or processes. A change in its value can lead to variations in execution paths, resource allocation, and overall system behavior, which can significantly impact execution time and memory consumption. For instance, if '_vId' determines the versioning of data structures or algorithms, altering it may cause the system to utilize different optimization strategies or data handling techniques, leading to noticeable performance fluctuations."
