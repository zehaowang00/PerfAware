Without specific information about the complexity and resource usage of `get_f().graph(g, x, lambda)`, it cannot be determined if this function incurs significant performance costs. The function itself does not perform any time-intensive or memory-intensive operations directly; it merely delegates to another method. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as performance-sensitive."
