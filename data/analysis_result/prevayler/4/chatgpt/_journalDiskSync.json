    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_journalDiskSync' configuration in the Prevayler software project directly influences how frequently data is synchronized to disk. A change in this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially during high transaction volumes, as it determines whether data is written to disk immediately or buffered for later writing. If set to sync too frequently, it can cause increased I/O operations, leading to higher latency and reduced throughput. Conversely, if set to sync less frequently, it may improve performance temporarily but risks data loss in case of a failure. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
