    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_transientMode' configuration in the Prevayler software project significantly impacts system performance by altering the way data is stored and retrieved. When enabled, it can lead to reduced memory consumption and faster execution times during transactions, as it bypasses certain persistence mechanisms. Conversely, disabling this mode can result in increased memory usage and slower performance due to the overhead of managing persistent data. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
