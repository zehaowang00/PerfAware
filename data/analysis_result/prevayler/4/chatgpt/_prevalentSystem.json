    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_prevalentSystem' configuration in the Prevayler project directly influences how data is stored and retrieved in memory. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or high transaction rates. For instance, if the configuration is altered to use a more complex data structure or a different persistence strategy, it can drastically affect the performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
