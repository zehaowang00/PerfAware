This mode is typically used for temporary data storage that does not require durability across application restarts.\\n\\n- **Persistent Mode**:\\n  - When `_transientMode` is `false`, the system opts for a more robust data storage solution by creating a `PersistentJournal<P>`. This involves several key components:\\n    - **PrevaylerDirectory**: This is initialized using the `prevalenceDirectory()` method, which determines the directory where persistent data will be stored. If `_prevalenceDirectory` is not set, it defaults to \\\"Prevalence\\\".\\n    - **Journal Size and Age Thresholds**: The parameters `_journalSizeThreshold` and `_journalAgeThreshold` dictate when the journal should be rolled over or archived, ensuring that it does not grow indefinitely.\\n    - **Disk Synchronization**: The `_journalDiskSync` configuration indicates how and when data should be synchronized to disk, which is critical for data integrity.\\n    - **Journal Suffix**: The `journalSuffix()` method provides a suffix for journal files, allowing for better organization and identification of journal files.\\n    - **Monitoring**: The `monitor()` method returns a monitoring object, which is likely used to track the health and status of the journaling process.\\n\\n#### Dependencies:\\n- The functionality of `_transientMode` is closely tied to the methods `prevalenceDirectory()`, `journalSuffix()`, and `monitor()`, which provide essential configurations for the persistent journal. The behavior of the journal system is thus dependent on these configurations, which collectively define how data is stored, managed, and monitored within the application.\\n\\nIn summary, `_transientMode` serves as a toggle that influences the overall data storage strategy of the system, determining whether data is stored temporarily or persistently, and it interacts with several other configuration parameters to ensure proper data management.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
