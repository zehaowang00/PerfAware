If set to sync after every operation, it may lead to high latency and slow performance due to frequent disk I/O operations. Conversely, if set to sync less frequently, it could improve performance but at the risk of data loss in case of a failure. Thus, this configuration has a substantial system-level performance impact due to its potential for time-intensive operations."
