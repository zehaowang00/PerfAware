The `PersistentJournal` involves operations that may be time-intensive due to disk I/O and managing journal size and age thresholds, which can significantly impact performance. In contrast, the `TransientJournal` operates in memory, which is generally faster. Therefore, the decision based on `_transientMode` can lead to substantial variations in performance based on the underlying operations involved in each journal type."
