It is instantiated within the `journal()` method when the system is not in transient mode.\n2. **PrevaylerDirectory**: The `PrevaylerDirectory` is created using the `prevalenceDirectory()` method, which serves as a storage location for the journal.

If set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage as more journal entries accumulate over time, potentially causing performance degradation during read/write operations. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent deletions and re-allocations, which can also impact performance. The management of journal entries is crucial for system performance, making this configuration sensitive to performance variations."
