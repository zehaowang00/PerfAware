If present, it uses these serializers along with `_primarySnapshotSuffix` to create the `GenericSnapshotManager`.\n- **JavaSerializer**: If no custom serializers are available, a default `JavaSerializer` is instantiated, which is then used to serialize snapshots with a default suffix of \"snapshot\".\n\n### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `prevalentSystem()` method is called to retrieve the current state of the system, which is essential for the snapshot manager to function correctly.\n- The `journalSerializer()` is also passed to the `GenericSnapshotManager`, indicating that the configuration interacts with journaling mechanisms that may log changes or events in the system.\n\nIn summary, the `_prevalentSystem` configuration is integral to the snapshot management process, ensuring that the system's state can be effectively serialized and stored for future recovery, while interacting with various components like serializers and directories."
