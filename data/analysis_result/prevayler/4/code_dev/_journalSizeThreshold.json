If set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage and slow down operations due to the increased size of the journal, which may require more time-consuming read/write operations. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent truncation, impacting performance due to repetitive write operations. Thus, it has substantial implications for system-level performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
