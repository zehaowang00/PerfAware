If the threshold is set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage and longer processing times during journal operations such as archiving or truncating, which are time-intensive and can significantly affect system performance. Conversely, if set too low, it could lead to frequent truncation, impacting performance due to increased overhead. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance."
