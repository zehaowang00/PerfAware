The `PersistentJournal` involves time-intensive operations related to file system interactions, such as writing data to disk and managing thresholds for journal size and age. These operations can lead to substantial variations in performance, especially under high data load or frequent write operations, making the `_transientMode` configuration critical for performance considerations."
