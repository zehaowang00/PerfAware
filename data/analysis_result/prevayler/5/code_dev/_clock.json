This method checks whether a remote server IP address is provided.

If the remote server IP is not set, the method defaults to creating a `CentralPublisher`.\n\nThe `_clock` configuration is accessed through the `clock()` method, which is likely responsible for providing the current time or a time-related service needed by the `CentralPublisher`. This indicates that the `CentralPublisher` may rely on time-based operations, such as timestamping transactions or managing time-sensitive data.\n\nKey components involved in this configuration include:\n- **TransactionPublisher**: An abstract representation of a publisher that handles transaction-related operations.\n- **ClientPublisher**: A concrete implementation of `TransactionPublisher` that communicates with a remote server.\n- **CentralPublisher**: Another implementation that likely operates locally and depends on the `_clock` for its functionality.\n\nThe interaction of `_clock` with `CentralPublisher` suggests that time management is integral to the operations performed by this publisher, enabling it to function correctly within the broader system context.
