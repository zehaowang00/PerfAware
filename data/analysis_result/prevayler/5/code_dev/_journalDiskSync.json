If set to synchronize data too frequently, it may result in time-intensive operations that can degrade overall system performance, particularly under heavy load or with large volumes of data. Conversely, if set to synchronize less frequently, it may improve performance but at the risk of data loss in case of a failure. Thus, the configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its influence on time-intensive disk operations."
