    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_prevalentSystem' configuration in the Prevayler project directly influences how data is persisted and retrieved in memory. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or high transaction volumes. If the prevalent system is configured to use a less efficient persistence strategy, it could result in increased latency and resource usage, thereby impacting overall system performance. Therefore, this configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
