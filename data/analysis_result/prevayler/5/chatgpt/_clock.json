    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_clock' configuration in the Prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timing and scheduling of transactions. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, as it affects how frequently the system processes events and updates the state. If the clock is set to a faster rate, it may increase the load on the system, leading to higher memory consumption and potential bottlenecks. Conversely, a slower clock may result in delayed processing, impacting overall performance. Therefore, any adjustments to the '_clock' configuration can significantly alter the system's performance characteristics."
