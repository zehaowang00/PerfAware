If set too high, it can lead to excessive memory consumption and slower performance due to the accumulation of old journal entries that must be processed or managed. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent disk writes and increased I/O operations, which can significantly impact system performance. The management of journal entries is critical in systems that rely on persistence, making this configuration a key factor in overall system performance."
