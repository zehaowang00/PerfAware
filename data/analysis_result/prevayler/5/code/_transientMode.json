The `PersistentJournal` involves operations related to disk I/O, which can be time-intensive and significantly impact system performance, especially with large journal sizes or when disk synchronization is enabled. In contrast, the `TransientJournal` operates in memory, which is generally faster but does not provide persistence. The choice between these two modes can lead to substantial variations in performance based on the operational context, making `_transientMode` a critical performance-sensitive configuration."
