The operations involved in creating the snapshot manager, including the initialization of the PrevaylerDirectory and the JavaSerializer, do not indicate substantial time-intensive or memory-intensive operations that would lead to significant performance variations. The impact of this configuration appears to be minor, as it does not involve heavy computational or memory overhead that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
