If set to a more aggressive sync strategy, it can lead to time-intensive disk I/O operations, causing delays in journal writing and overall system responsiveness. Conversely, a less aggressive setting may improve performance but risks data loss in case of a failure. Thus, this configuration can lead to substantial variations in performance based on its settings."
