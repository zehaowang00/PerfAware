When set to true, the system operates in memory, allowing for faster data processing and reduced latency. Conversely, when set to false, the system engages in disk I/O operations for persistent storage, which can be time-intensive and resource-heavy, especially under high-frequency logging conditions. This variability in performance based on the operational mode, along with the potential impact of different workloads and disk types, underscores the critical nature of `_transientMode` as a performance-sensitive configuration.\", \"Note\": \"The AI agent has provided suggestions for further performance analysis.\"}"
