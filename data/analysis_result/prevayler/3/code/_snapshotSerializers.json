            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `_snapshotSerializers` configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by determining how snapshots are serialized and deserialized. If the serialization process is time-intensive or memory-heavy, it can lead to significant delays in creating or restoring the state of the system, especially in scenarios involving large datasets or frequent state changes. This can cause substantial variations in system performance, making it a critical configuration to monitor and optimize."
