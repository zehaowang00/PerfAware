The `PersistentJournal` involves operations that can be time-intensive due to disk I/O and managing journal size and age thresholds, which can significantly impact system performance. In contrast, the `TransientJournal` operates in memory, which is generally faster but may lead to data loss. The decision to use one over the other can lead to substantial variations in performance based on the operational context, making this configuration critical for performance sensitivity."
