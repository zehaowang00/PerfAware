If set to a more aggressive sync strategy, it could lead to increased I/O operations, potentially causing time-intensive delays. Conversely, a less aggressive setting may improve performance but risks data integrity. Given that disk I/O is typically a bottleneck in performance-sensitive applications, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance."
