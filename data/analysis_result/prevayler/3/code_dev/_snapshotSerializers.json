            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The creation of the `Prevayler` involves managing snapshots and transactions, which can be time-intensive operations, especially if the snapshot manager handles large amounts of data or complex object graphs. The performance impact is significant due to potential delays in serialization and deserialization processes, especially when dealing with large snapshots or journal files. Additionally, the configuration of `_transactionDeepCopyMode` can lead to increased memory usage and processing time if deep copies of transactions are required. Thus, this configuration directly influences the system's performance in a substantial manner."
