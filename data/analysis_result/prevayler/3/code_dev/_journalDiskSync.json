Depending on its setting, this configuration can result in time-intensive operations, particularly during high-frequency write scenarios where data integrity is paramount. If the synchronization is synchronous, it can introduce latency, impacting overall system performance during critical operations. Conversely, if it is asynchronous, it may improve performance but at the potential cost of data integrity during failures. Thus, its impact on system-level performance is substantial, classifying it as performance sensitive."
