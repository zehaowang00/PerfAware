            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The initialization of the `GenericSnapshotManager` involves potentially time-intensive operations, particularly when dealing with serialization of snapshots, which can be memory-heavy and time-consuming depending on the size and complexity of the objects being serialized. The use of different serializers, including the default `JavaSerializer`, can significantly impact performance, especially if large amounts of data are involved. Additionally, the management of snapshot files in the `PrevaylerDirectory` can also introduce performance overhead if not handled efficiently. Therefore, this configuration can lead to substantial variations in system performance."
