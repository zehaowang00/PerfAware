This parameter is utilized when instantiating the `PrevaylerImpl` class, which is responsible for managing the persistence and retrieval of transactions in a prevalent system.\n\n### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Purpose**: The `_transactionDeepCopyMode` configuration determines how transactions are handled during the serialization process. It influences whether a deep copy of the transaction objects is created, which can affect how changes to the original objects are managed during processing.\n  \n### Key Components Involved:\n- **Prevayler**: The main component that utilizes the configuration. It manages the state of the system by applying transactions and maintaining snapshots.\n- **GenericSnapshotManager**: This component is responsible for managing snapshots of the system's state, which are crucial for recovery and consistency.\n- **TransactionPublisher**: This component publishes transactions to the `Prevayler`, ensuring that they are processed in the correct order.\n- **ServerListener**: If the `_serverPort` is set, this component listens for incoming transactions over the network, allowing remote clients to interact with the system.\n\n### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `_transactionDeepCopyMode` interacts with the `journalSerializer()` method, which is responsible for serializing transactions for persistence. The configuration affects how the transactions are stored and retrieved, thus influencing the overall behavior of the `Prevayler`.\n- The conditional instantiation of `ServerListener` based on `_serverPort` indicates that the configuration can also dictate whether the system operates in a standalone mode or as a networked service.\n\nIn summary, `_transactionDeepCopyMode` is a configuration parameter that influences transaction handling within the `Prevayler`, affecting serialization and potentially the integrity of transaction processing in the system. Its interactions with components like `GenericSnapshotManager` and `TransactionPublisher` highlight its importance in maintaining the system's state and functionality."
