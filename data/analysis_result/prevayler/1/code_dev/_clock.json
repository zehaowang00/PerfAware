This method determines how transactions are published based on the availability of a remote server IP address.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `_clock` configuration provides a timekeeping mechanism that is essential for the `CentralPublisher`. It likely ensures that transactions are timestamped or managed in a time-sensitive manner, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and order of operations within the system.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **`CentralPublisher`**: This class utilizes the `_clock` configuration to manage transaction publishing when there is no remote server available. It indicates that the local system can handle transactions using its own timekeeping.\n- **`journal()`**: This method is called alongside `clock()` to provide additional context or data management capabilities to the `CentralPublisher`. The interaction between the clock and the journal is vital for maintaining a coherent state of transactions.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The `_clock` configuration depends on the overall system's ability to provide accurate timekeeping. Its implementation may rely on system time or a custom time source.\n- The decision to use `CentralPublisher` instead of `ClientPublisher` is contingent upon the presence of `_remoteServerIpAddress`, indicating that the configuration plays a role in determining the operational mode of the transaction publishing system.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `_clock` interacts closely with the `CentralPublisher`, which is responsible for handling local transactions. This interaction ensures that the system can still function effectively even when remote publishing is not available. The method's conditional logic highlights how the presence or absence of a remote server influences the configuration's role, showcasing its importance in the overall architecture of the transaction management system. \n\nIn summary, the `_clock` configuration is integral to the local transaction handling capabilities of the system, ensuring that time-sensitive operations are managed correctly when remote interactions are not possible."
