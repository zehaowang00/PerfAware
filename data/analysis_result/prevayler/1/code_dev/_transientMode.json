Its primary purpose is to toggle between two modes of journal handling: transient and persistent.\n\n1. **Purpose**: \n   - When `_transientMode` is set to `true`, the method instantiates a `TransientJournal<P>`, which is likely designed for temporary data storage that does not require durability.\n   - Conversely, when `_transientMode` is `false`, a `PersistentJournal<P>` is created, which is intended for durable data storage, ensuring that data is preserved across application restarts.\n\n2. **Key Components**:\n   - **TransientJournal**: This component handles temporary data and is suitable for scenarios where data persistence is not necessary.\n   - **PersistentJournal**: This component requires additional configuration parameters such as `PrevaylerDirectory`, `_journalSizeThreshold`, `_journalAgeThreshold`, `_journalDiskSync`, `journalSuffix()`, and `monitor()`. These parameters define how the persistent journal operates, including its storage location, size limits, synchronization behavior, and monitoring capabilities.\n\n3. **Dependencies**:\n   - The `PersistentJournal` depends on the `PrevaylerDirectory`, which is initialized using the `prevalenceDirectory()` method.
