This threshold helps in controlling how much data can be stored in the journal before certain actions, such as data archival or cleanup, may be triggered. \n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n- **PersistentJournal**: This class utilizes the `_journalSizeThreshold` to enforce limits on the journal size, ensuring that it does not grow indefinitely.\n- **PrevaylerDirectory**: This component is created using the `prevalenceDirectory()` method and serves as the storage location for the journal. It is a dependency for the `PersistentJournal`.\n- **Other Configuration Parameters**: The `_journalAgeThreshold`, `_journalDiskSync`, and `journalSuffix()` are also passed to the `PersistentJournal`, indicating that the journal's behavior is influenced by multiple configuration parameters.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The method `journal()` checks the `_transientMode` flag to decide whether to return a `TransientJournal` or a `PersistentJournal`. If `_transientMode` is false, it creates a `PersistentJournal` that relies on the `_journalSizeThreshold` along with other parameters to manage data persistence effectively.\n- The configuration interacts with the overall data management strategy of the system, ensuring that the journal operates within defined limits, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and organization.\n\nIn summary, `_journalSizeThreshold` is a pivotal configuration that influences the behavior of the `PersistentJournal`, impacting how data is stored and managed in the system."

If the threshold is set too high, it may result in excessive memory usage and slower performance due to larger data handling and potential delays in data archival or cleanup processes.
