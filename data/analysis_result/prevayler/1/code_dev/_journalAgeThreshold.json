            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `_journalAgeThreshold` directly influences the retention and removal of journal entries in the `PersistentJournal`, which can lead to significant performance variations. If the threshold is set too high, it may result in excessive memory usage as more entries are retained, potentially leading to slower operations during data retrieval and processing. Conversely, a low threshold may trigger frequent removals, impacting performance during write operations. Thus, the configuration's impact on memory management and operational efficiency classifies it as performance-sensitive."
