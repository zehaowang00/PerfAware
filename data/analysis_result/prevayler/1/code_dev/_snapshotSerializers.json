It is instantiated through the `snapshotManager()` method, which likely encapsulates the logic for snapshot handling.\n\n2. **TransactionPublisher**: This component is created by invoking the `publisher(snapshotManager)` method. It serves as a mediator for publishing transactions to the system, ensuring that changes are communicated effectively.\n\n3. **journalSerializer**: This method is responsible for providing a serializer for the journal, which records all transactions. The serialized data is crucial for recovering the application's state.\n\n4. **_transactionDeepCopyMode**: This configuration parameter determines how transactions are copied, influencing how the system handles transaction data.\n\nThe `create` method integrates these components to construct a `PrevaylerImpl`, which combines the snapshot management, transaction publishing, and serialization mechanisms.
