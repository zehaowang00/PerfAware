If this threshold is set too high, it could lead to excessive memory usage and slower performance due to the accumulation of journal entries, which may require more time-intensive operations for data retrieval and management. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent disk writes, impacting performance. Thus, the configuration has a substantial system-level performance impact."
