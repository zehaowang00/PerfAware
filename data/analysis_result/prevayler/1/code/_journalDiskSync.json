If set to a value that causes frequent disk writes, it could lead to substantial delays in operations due to the time-intensive nature of disk I/O. Conversely, if it minimizes disk writes, it may improve performance but at the risk of data loss. Therefore, this configuration can lead to extreme variations in performance based on its setting."
