The `PersistentJournal` involves operations that may include disk I/O, which is typically time-intensive and can significantly impact system performance, especially with large data sets or high-frequency write operations. In contrast, the `TransientJournal` operates in memory, which is generally faster but may not be suitable for all use cases. Therefore, the decision based on `_transientMode` can lead to substantial variations in performance due to the underlying differences in how data is managed and persisted."
