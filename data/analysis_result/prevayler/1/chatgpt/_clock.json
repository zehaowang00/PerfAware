    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_clock' configuration in the Prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timing and scheduling of transactions within the system. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, as it affects how frequently the system processes and commits transactions. If the clock is set to a slower rate, it may result in increased latency for transaction processing, while a faster rate could lead to higher memory consumption due to more frequent state snapshots. Therefore, adjustments to the '_clock' configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
