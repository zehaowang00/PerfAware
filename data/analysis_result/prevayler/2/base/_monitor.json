The justification provided accurately reflects the nature of monitoring operations, which typically incur minimal overhead. The analysis highlights that while monitoring can have some impact, it does not lead to significant resource consumption or performance variations during normal operations. The fallback to `SimpleMonitor` further supports the argument that the configuration does not introduce substantial performance penalties. Overall, the assessment aligns with the expected behavior of monitoring systems in software applications, confirming that the impact of `_monitor` is not substantial enough to classify it as performance-sensitive."
