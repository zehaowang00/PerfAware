If set to a high frequency, it may lead to increased I/O operations, causing time-intensive delays during write operations. Conversely, if set too low, it may risk data loss but improve performance. Therefore, the choice of this configuration can lead to substantial variations in system performance based on the disk I/O characteristics and the application's workload."
