If this threshold is set too high, it could lead to excessive memory usage due to the accumulation of journal entries, resulting in significant performance degradation during read and write operations. Additionally, the management of older journal entries can become time-intensive, especially if the system has to process a large volume of data, making this configuration critical for overall system performance."
