The `PersistentJournal` involves operations related to disk I/O and data persistence, which can be time-intensive and memory-heavy, especially with parameters like `_journalSizeThreshold` and `_journalAgeThreshold` that could significantly impact performance based on the volume of data being managed. In contrast, the `TransientJournal` operates in memory, which is typically faster but may not be suitable for all use cases. Thus, the configuration can lead to substantial performance variations based on the mode selected."
