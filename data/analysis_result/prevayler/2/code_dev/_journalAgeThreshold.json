This parameter is utilized when creating an instance of `PersistentJournal`, which is responsible for managing persistent data storage in the system.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **PersistentJournal**: This class is designed to handle the storage and retrieval of journal entries. It relies on several configuration parameters, including `_journalAgeThreshold`, to manage how long journal entries are retained before they are considered outdated and eligible for removal.\n- **PrevaylerDirectory**: This component is instantiated with the `prevalenceDirectory()` method, which likely provides the path or location for storing persistent data. The `PrevaylerDirectory` acts as a container for the journal, ensuring that data is organized and accessible.\n- **TransientJournal**: In cases where `_transientMode` is enabled, the system opts for a `TransientJournal`, which does not utilize the `_journalAgeThreshold` since it does not persist data beyond the current session.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe method `journal()` determines which type of journal to instantiate based on the `_transientMode` flag. If the system is operating in transient mode, it bypasses the use of `_journalAgeThreshold` entirely. However, when operating in persistent mode, `_journalAgeThreshold` is critical for managing the lifecycle of journal entries, influencing how data is stored and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, `_journalAgeThreshold` is a key configuration parameter that directly impacts the behavior of the `PersistentJournal`, ensuring that the system can effectively manage the retention of journal entries based on their age, thereby facilitating organized data management within the application."

If the threshold is set too high, it may result in excessive memory usage due to the accumulation of outdated journal entries, potentially leading to time-intensive operations during data retrieval and cleanup. Conversely, a low threshold may cause frequent purging of entries, impacting performance during write operations. Thus, the configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance due to its impact on memory management and operational efficiency."
