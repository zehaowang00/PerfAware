    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_transientMode' configuration in the Prevayler software project directly influences how data is persisted and managed in memory. When enabled, it can lead to significant changes in execution time and memory consumption, especially during high transaction loads. If the mode is set to transient, it may reduce the overhead of writing to disk, thus improving performance during transactions, but at the risk of data loss in case of a failure. Conversely, disabling it may ensure data durability but could introduce latency due to increased I/O operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
