    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The '_nullSnapshotManager' configuration in the Prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how snapshots of the system state are managed. If this configuration is set to a value that disables or improperly manages snapshots, it can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times during data recovery processes. Snapshots are crucial for maintaining system performance and stability, especially in scenarios involving large datasets or high transaction volumes. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
