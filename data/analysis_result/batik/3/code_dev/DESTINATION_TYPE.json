It is primarily responsible for defining the expected file type for the conversion results, which is used throughout various methods in the codebase.\n\n#### Key Functions and Interactions:\n\n1. **File Validation**:\n   - The method `isFile(File f)` utilizes `destinationType.getExtension()` to ascertain whether a given file is considered valid based on its extension. If the file does not exist, it is deemed valid if its name ends with the expected extension defined by `DESTINATION_TYPE`. This ensures that only files of the correct type are processed.\n\n2. **Conversion Execution**:\n   - In the `execute()` method, `destinationType` is used to retrieve the appropriate transcoder via `destinationType.getTranscoder()`. This transcoder is essential for converting the source files into the desired output format. If the transcoder is not available, an exception is thrown, indicating a critical dependency on the `DESTINATION_TYPE` for successful execution.\n\n3. **Transcoding Hints**:\n   - The configuration also influences the transcoding process by allowing the computation of transcoding hints through `computeTranscodingHints()`, which are then set on the transcoder. This interaction ensures that the conversion process adheres to the specifications defined by the `DESTINATION_TYPE`.\n\n4. **Output File Naming**:\n   - The method `getDestinationFile(String file)` modifies the output filename based on the extension provided by `destinationType.getExtension()`. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that the output files have the correct format, aligning with the expectations set by the `DESTINATION_TYPE`.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The `DESTINATION_TYPE` is dependent on the `Transcoder` class, which is responsible for the actual conversion of files. Additionally, it interacts with other components such as `SVGConverterSource` and the controller that manages the overall conversion process.\n\nIn summary, the `DESTINATION_TYPE` configuration is integral to the file conversion workflow, influencing file validation, output naming, and the selection of the transcoder, thereby ensuring that the conversion process adheres to the specified output format."
