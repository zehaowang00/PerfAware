Its primary purpose is to retrieve the user-defined stylesheet URI from the `TranscodingHints`, which is a collection of hints that can influence the transcoding process.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method first attempts to extract the value associated with `KEY_USER_STYLESHEET_URI` from the `hints` map. If a valid URI is found, it is returned as the user stylesheet.\n- If no user stylesheet URI is specified (i.e., if the retrieved value is `null`), the method falls back to invoking the superclass's implementation of `getUserStyleSheetURI`, ensuring that a default behavior is maintained.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SVGAbstractTranscoder**: This class serves as the base for transcoding SVG images, and it holds the `hints` map that contains various configuration parameters, including the user stylesheet URI.\n- **TranscodingHints**: This is a key component that allows users to specify various hints that can modify the transcoding behavior, including stylesheets.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `USER_STYLESHEET_URI` interacts directly with the `hints` map, which is central to the configuration management of the transcoding process.\n- By allowing users to specify a custom stylesheet, this configuration enhances the flexibility and customization of the SVG rendering process, enabling tailored visual outputs based on user preferences.\n\nOverall, the `USER_STYLESHEET_URI` configuration plays a crucial role in determining how SVG content is styled during transcoding, facilitating user customization while maintaining a fallback mechanism for default behavior."
