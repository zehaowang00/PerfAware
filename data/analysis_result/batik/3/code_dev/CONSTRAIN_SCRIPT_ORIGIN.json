This is essential for ensuring that only scripts from allowed origins can be executed, thereby enhancing security.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **Key Component**: `KEY_CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN` is a constant that represents the configuration key used to retrieve the constraint setting from the `hints` map in the `SVGAbstractTranscoder` class.\n- **Script Security Classes**: Depending on the value of `constrainOrigin`, the method returns either a `DefaultScriptSecurity` instance (if the origin is constrained) or a `RelaxedScriptSecurity` instance (if it is not). These classes encapsulate the security policies applicable to the script.\n\n### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The method checks if the `hints` map contains the `KEY_CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN` key. If present, it retrieves its boolean value to determine the behavior of script loading.\n- The `getScriptSecurity` method interacts with other parts of the system by providing the appropriate security settings based on the configuration, which can affect how scripts are executed within the context of the document.\n\nIn summary, the `CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN` configuration is integral to the security framework of the system, dictating the conditions under which scripts can be loaded and executed, thus ensuring that security policies are adhered to based on the specified origin constraints."
