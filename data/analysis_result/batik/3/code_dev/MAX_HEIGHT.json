It is utilized in the `setImageSize` method, which adjusts the dimensions of an image based on specified hints and the document's dimensions.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `MAX_HEIGHT` configuration is to enforce constraints on the height of images to ensure they do not exceed a specified limit. This helps maintain a consistent layout and prevents images from being disproportionately large relative to their intended display context.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method checks if the `hints` map contains a key for `MAX_HEIGHT`. If it does, the value associated with this key is retrieved and stored in the `imgMaxHeight` variable.\n- The method then compares the current height of the image with the `imgMaxHeight`. If the current height exceeds this maximum value, the image's dimensions are recalculated to fit within the specified maximum height while maintaining the aspect ratio based on the document's width and height.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The `hints` map is a key component that provides various configuration parameters, including `MAX_HEIGHT`. This indicates that the method relies on external input to determine the maximum height constraint.\n- The global variables `width` and `height` are modified based on the calculations performed within this method, indicating a direct dependency on these variables for the image size adjustments.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `setImageSize` method interacts with other components of the system by modifying the global `width` and `height` variables based on the `MAX_HEIGHT` configuration. This method is likely called during the image rendering or processing phases, where ensuring that images conform to specified size constraints is essential for maintaining the overall layout and user experience.\n\nIn summary, the `MAX_HEIGHT` configuration is integral to managing image dimensions, ensuring that images remain within specified limits, and interacting with other components through the adjustment of global size variables."
