    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering and processing of graphical elements. A change in this configuration can lead to variations in the amount of data processed during rendering operations, which can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption. For instance, increasing the width may require more memory for storing larger images or more complex graphical data, leading to longer processing times and potential performance bottlenecks. Conversely, reducing the width could improve performance by decreasing the amount of data handled, but may also compromise the quality of the output. Therefore, the impact of changing the 'WIDTH' configuration is substantial enough to classify it as performance-sensitive."
