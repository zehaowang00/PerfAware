    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration in the batik software project primarily affects the visual rendering of graphics and does not significantly impact execution time or memory consumption. Changes to color values are processed at a graphical level, which typically involves minimal computational overhead compared to other configurations that directly influence data processing or resource allocation. Therefore, variations in BACKGROUND_COLOR do not lead to notable variations in system performance."
