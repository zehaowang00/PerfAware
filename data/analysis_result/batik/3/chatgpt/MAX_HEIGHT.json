    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of SVG images. A change in MAX_HEIGHT can lead to significant variations in the amount of memory consumed during image processing and can also affect the execution time for rendering operations. If the height is set too high, it may result in excessive memory usage, leading to potential performance degradation or even out-of-memory errors. Conversely, setting it too low may cause additional processing overhead due to frequent resizing or clipping of images, impacting overall performance."
