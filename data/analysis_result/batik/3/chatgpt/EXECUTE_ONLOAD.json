    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences when and how resources are loaded and executed in the application. Changing this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, as it determines whether certain operations are performed immediately upon loading or deferred until necessary. If set to execute on load, it may increase initial load times and memory consumption due to preloading resources, while deferring execution can improve responsiveness but may lead to delays when resources are accessed later. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
