    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration in the Batik software project directly influences how frequently snapshots of the rendering state are captured. A lower SNAPSHOT_TIME value can lead to more frequent captures, which may significantly increase memory consumption and processing overhead, resulting in longer execution times. Conversely, a higher value may reduce resource usage but could lead to loss of critical rendering information. Therefore, changes in this configuration can notably affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
