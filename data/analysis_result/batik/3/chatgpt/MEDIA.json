    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'MEDIA' configuration option in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how media content is processed and rendered. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when handling large media files or complex graphics. For instance, if the configuration is set to a lower quality or resolution, it may reduce memory consumption and improve rendering speed, while higher settings could increase resource usage and slow down performance. Therefore, adjusting the 'MEDIA' configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
