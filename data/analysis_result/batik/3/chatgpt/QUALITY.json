    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering quality of graphics and images. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially when processing high-resolution images or complex vector graphics. Higher quality settings may require more computational resources and memory, resulting in longer execution times and increased memory usage, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
