    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the rendering of text in graphics. While changing the font family may impact the visual output and potentially the time taken to render text, it does not significantly affect overall system performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption in a way that would be classified as performance-sensitive. The rendering process is typically optimized for various font types, and the impact on performance is minimal compared to other configurations that directly influence processing or resource allocation."
