    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how scripts are handled during the rendering process. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in the execution time of script processing, as it may restrict or allow certain script origins, impacting the efficiency of resource loading and execution. If the configuration is set to allow more origins, it may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times due to the overhead of managing additional scripts. Conversely, constraining the origins can optimize performance by reducing the number of scripts processed, thus significantly affecting overall system performance."
