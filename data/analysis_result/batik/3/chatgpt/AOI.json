    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The AOI (Area of Interest) configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of vector graphics. Changes in the AOI can lead to significant variations in the amount of data processed during rendering, which in turn affects execution time and memory consumption. A larger AOI may require more resources to process and render graphics, leading to increased execution time and memory usage, while a smaller AOI may optimize performance by reducing the amount of data handled. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
