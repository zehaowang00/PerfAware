    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'USER_STYLESHEET_URI' in the Batik project primarily affects the styling of SVG content rather than core processing or rendering performance. Changes to this URI may alter the appearance of the output but do not significantly impact execution time or memory consumption of the rendering engine. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
