    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration in the Batik software project determines how the output is generated and can significantly influence the rendering performance and memory usage. For instance, changing the destination from a simple output stream to a more complex format (like SVG or PDF) can lead to increased processing time and higher memory consumption due to the additional overhead of handling different formats. This can result in notable variations in execution time, especially for large graphics or complex documents, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
