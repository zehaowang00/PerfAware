    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is accessed and stored in memory. Changing this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex graphics rendering tasks. An indexed approach can optimize search and retrieval operations, reducing the overall memory consumption and improving performance, while a non-indexed approach may result in slower access times and increased memory usage due to less efficient data handling."
