    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration in the Batik software project can significantly impact performance due to variations in text processing, rendering, and localization. Different languages may require different character sets, which can affect memory consumption and processing time during rendering operations. Additionally, the complexity of language-specific features, such as handling right-to-left text or specific font rendering, can lead to notable variations in execution time. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to measurable differences in system performance."
