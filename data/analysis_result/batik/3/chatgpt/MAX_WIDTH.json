    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering and processing of SVG images. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in the execution time and memory consumption, particularly when handling large or complex SVG files. If MAX_WIDTH is set too high, it may result in excessive memory usage and longer processing times, while a lower value could lead to quicker rendering but may truncate or distort the output. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
