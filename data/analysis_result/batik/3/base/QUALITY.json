If this hint is present in the `hints` map, its value is used as the quality setting.\n   - If the `KEY_QUALITY` hint is not provided, a default quality of `0.75f` is used, and an error is logged indicating that the quality was unspecified.\n\n2. **Image Resolution**:\n   - The resolution for the image is calculated based on the pixel size in millimeters obtained from `userAgent.getPixelUnitToMillimeter()`. This value is converted to inches and set in the `ImageWriterParams`.\n\n3. **Output Stream Handling**:\n   - The output stream is wrapped in an `OutputStreamWrapper` to handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring that any stream closing exceptions do not affect subsequent calls.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - If an `IOException` occurs during the writing process, a `TranscoderException` is thrown.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis method effectively configures the image quality and resolution based on provided hints and defaults, ensuring that the image is written to the output stream correctly while handling potential errors."
