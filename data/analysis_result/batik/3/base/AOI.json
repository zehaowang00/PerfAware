Here are the key configuration-related aspects:\\n\\n1. **Area of Interest (AOI)**:\\n   - The code checks if the `hints` map contains a key `KEY_AOI`. If it does, the area of interest (AOI) is retrieved and used to transform the image's coordinate system.\\n   - The transformation involves scaling and translating based on the AOI dimensions, ensuring that the output image respects the specified area.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic State Handling**:\\n   - The method checks for a `KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD` hint to determine if the document is dynamic. If so, it sets the bridge context's dynamic state, which may affect how the document is processed and rendered.\\n\\n3. **Image Size Configuration**:\\n   - The `setImageSize` method adjusts the global `width` and `height` variables based on the document's dimensions or the AOI if specified. If scaling is not required (as indicated by the `KEY_SCALE_TO_PAGE` hint), the original document dimensions are retained.\\n\\n4. **ViewBox and Aspect Ratio**:\\n   - If no AOI is specified, the code attempts to derive transformation parameters from the `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio` attributes of the SVG document. This ensures that the transcoded image maintains the intended aspect ratio.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe configuration parameters primarily revolve around the handling of the AOI, dynamic document states, and image size adjustments based on hints provided.

If found, it retrieves the corresponding `Rectangle2D` object representing the AOI.\\n   - The transformation of the AOI into the image's coordinate system is performed using an `AffineTransform`. This involves scaling and translating the AOI dimensions to ensure that the output image accurately reflects the specified area.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The AOI configuration relies on the `hints` map, which serves as a central repository for various configuration parameters. The presence of specific keys in this map dictates how the transcoding process adapts to user-defined requirements.\\n   - The configuration interacts with the `setImageSize` method, which adjusts the global width and height based on the AOI dimensions if specified.\\n\\n4. **Interactions with Other Components**:\\n   - The AOI configuration is integral to the overall image rendering process.
