This operation is not inherently time-intensive or memory-intensive, as it deals with a string and a small number of tokens. The use of `StringTokenizer` and `LinkedList` does not indicate a significant performance impact, as the operations performed are lightweight and do not involve large data structures or complex computations. Therefore, this configuration does not cause substantial performance variations."
