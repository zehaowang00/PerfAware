            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: The `MAX_HEIGHT` configuration primarily serves to enforce constraints on image dimensions without involving time-intensive or memory-heavy operations. The operations performed within the `setImageSize` method, such as retrieving values from a map and performing basic arithmetic calculations, are lightweight and do not significantly impact system performance. The method's logic is straightforward and does not introduce substantial delays or memory overhead, thus classifying it as performance insensitive."
