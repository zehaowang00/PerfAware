            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Summary of the Configuration's Role: DESTINATION_TYPE\n\nThe `DESTINATION_TYPE` configuration plays a crucial role in the file conversion process within the system. Its primary purpose is to define the target file type for the output generated by the conversion operation. This configuration is essential for determining how the input files are processed and what format the resulting files will take.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Transcoder**: The `destinationType` is directly linked to a `Transcoder`, which is responsible for converting the source files into the specified output format. The transcoder is retrieved using `destinationType.getTranscoder()`, and if it is not available, an exception is thrown, indicating a critical failure in accessing the necessary conversion tool.\n\n2. **File Naming**: The configuration also influences the naming of the output files through the method `getDestinationFile(String file)`. This method modifies the file name by changing its suffix to match the defined output type, ensuring that the resulting files have the correct format.\n\n3. **Transcoding Hints**: The configuration interacts with transcoding hints, which are additional parameters that can influence the conversion process. These hints are computed and set on the transcoder, allowing for customization of the conversion behavior based on the destination type.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `execute()` method orchestrates the conversion process by first determining the destination files based on the source files and the `dst` variable. It checks if a single source file is provided and whether the destination is valid, thereby establishing a direct dependency on the `destinationType` configuration.\n  \n- The configuration's role is further emphasized in the error handling within the `execute()` method. If the transcoder cannot be accessed, it raises an `SVGConverterException`, highlighting the importance of the `destinationType` in the overall functionality of the conversion process.\n\nIn summary, the `DESTINATION_TYPE` configuration is integral to defining the output format of converted files, managing the transcoding process, and ensuring that the output files are correctly named and formatted. Its interactions with the transcoder and file naming logic are essential for the successful execution of the conversion tasks within the system."
