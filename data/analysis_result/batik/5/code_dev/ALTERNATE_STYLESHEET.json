This functionality is encapsulated in the `getAlternateStyleSheet()` method, which first attempts to obtain the alternate style-sheet title from a `hints` map using the `KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET` key.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **hints Map**: This is a collection that stores various configuration parameters, including the alternate style-sheet title. It acts as a source for retrieving user-specific or context-specific configurations.\n- **KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET**: This constant serves as the key to access the alternate style-sheet title within the `hints` map.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. The method checks if there is a value associated with `KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET` in the `hints` map.\n2. If a value exists, it returns that value, effectively allowing customization of the style sheet based on user preferences or specific contexts.\n3. If no alternate style-sheet title is found in the `hints`, the method falls back to the superclass's implementation of `getAlternateStyleSheet()`, ensuring that a default behavior is maintained.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThis configuration interacts primarily with the `hints` data structure and the superclass method. It allows for flexibility in styling by enabling the retrieval of user-defined style sheets, which can be crucial for applications that require dynamic styling based on user preferences or specific conditions.\n\nOverall, the `ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET` configuration plays a vital role in enhancing the user experience by allowing for customizable visual representations within the system."
