It checks if the `KEY_ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES` exists in the `hints` map. If it does, the method retrieves the associated string, which contains the allowed script types separated by commas.\n- The method then tokenizes this string and populates a `LinkedList` with each valid script type. This list can subsequently be used to validate or restrict the types of scripts that can be processed by the system.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **SVGAbstractTranscoder**: This class holds the `hints` map, which is crucial for accessing various configuration settings, including `ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES`.\n- **LinkedList**: This data structure is used to store the allowed script types dynamically.\n- **StringTokenizer**: This utility is employed to split the comma-separated string of allowed script types into individual tokens.\n\n### Interactions:\n- The `computeAllowedScripts` method directly interacts with the `hints` map to fetch the configuration value. It processes this value to build a list that can be referenced by other components of the system that require knowledge of valid script types.\n- By defining allowed script types, this configuration helps ensure that the system adheres to specified standards or security requirements regarding script execution, thereby influencing how other parts of the system handle script processing.\n\nIn summary, `ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES` plays a critical role in defining acceptable script types, ensuring that the system operates within defined parameters and interacts correctly with other components that rely on this configuration."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: The method `computeAllowedScripts` primarily involves string manipulation and the creation of a `LinkedList` to store allowed script types. The operations performed, such as checking for the presence of a key in a map, retrieving a string, and tokenizing that string, are not inherently time-intensive or memory-heavy. The performance impact of processing a list of script types is minimal and does not lead to significant variations in system performance, as it is executed infrequently and does not involve large data sets or complex computations."
