It is utilized in the `setImageSize` method, which adjusts the dimensions of an image based on specified hints, ensuring that the image fits within the constraints of the document's dimensions.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `MAX_WIDTH` configuration is to impose a limit on the width of the image being processed. This ensures that images do not exceed a specified maximum width, which can be crucial for maintaining layout consistency and visual integrity in document rendering.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method checks if the `hints` map contains the `KEY_MAX_WIDTH`. If present, it retrieves the maximum width value and assigns it to the `imgMaxWidth` variable.\n- The method then compares the current width of the image against this maximum width. If the current width exceeds `imgMaxWidth`, it adjusts the width to `imgMaxWidth` and recalculates the height to maintain the aspect ratio based on the original document dimensions.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The `hints` map is a key component that holds various configuration values, including `MAX_WIDTH`. This map must be populated with the appropriate values before invoking the `setImageSize` method.\n- Global variables `width` and `height` are modified based on the calculations performed within this method, indicating that the method interacts directly with the state of the object.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `MAX_WIDTH` configuration interacts with other parts of the system by influencing how images are rendered in relation to the document's overall layout. By ensuring that images adhere to the specified maximum width, it contributes to the overall presentation and formatting of documents processed by the system. This configuration is part of a broader set of hints that may include other dimensions (like height) and aspect ratio considerations, indicating a collaborative relationship with other configuration parameters."
