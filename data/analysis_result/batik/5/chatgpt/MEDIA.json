    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MEDIA configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how media resources are handled and rendered. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly when processing large media files or complex graphics. For instance, altering the encoding settings or resource loading strategies can either optimize or degrade performance, impacting the overall responsiveness and efficiency of the application. Therefore, adjustments to the MEDIA configuration can have a substantial effect on system performance."
