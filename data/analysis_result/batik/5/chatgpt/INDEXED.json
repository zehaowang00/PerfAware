    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is accessed and manipulated within the rendering process. When the value of 'INDEXED' is changed, it can lead to significant variations in execution time due to differences in data retrieval methods, which can affect memory consumption and processing speed. For instance, using indexed access can optimize performance for certain operations, while non-indexed access may result in slower execution times and increased memory usage. Thus, any change in this configuration can lead to notable performance impacts."
