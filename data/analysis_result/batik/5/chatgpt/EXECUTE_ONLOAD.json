    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences when and how resources are loaded and executed. If this configuration is set to execute resources on load, it can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially if large resources are involved. Conversely, if it is set to defer execution, it may reduce initial load times and memory usage, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect the application's responsiveness and resource utilization."
