    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option SNAPSHOT_TIME in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the frequency and duration of snapshot operations during rendering processes. A lower SNAPSHOT_TIME can lead to more frequent snapshots, which may increase memory usage and processing time, while a higher value may reduce the overhead but could result in stale data being processed. This variability can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption, making it crucial for performance tuning."
