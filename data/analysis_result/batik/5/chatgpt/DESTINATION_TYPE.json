    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration in the Batik software project determines how output is rendered, which can significantly impact performance. Different destination types (e.g., rendering to a file, screen, or a network stream) can lead to variations in execution time and memory usage due to differences in buffering, data processing, and resource allocation. For instance, rendering to a file may involve disk I/O operations that are slower compared to rendering directly to the screen, leading to notable variations in performance based on the selected destination type."
