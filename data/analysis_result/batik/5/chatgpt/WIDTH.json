    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of graphics. A change in the WIDTH value can lead to significant variations in the amount of memory allocated for image processing and the execution time required for rendering operations. For instance, increasing the WIDTH may result in higher memory consumption and longer processing times due to the increased complexity of rendering larger images, while decreasing it could improve performance but at the cost of image quality. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
