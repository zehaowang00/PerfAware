    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering quality of graphics and images. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when processing high-resolution images or complex vector graphics. Higher quality settings typically require more computational resources and memory, resulting in increased processing time and potential memory consumption. Conversely, lower quality settings can lead to faster execution but at the cost of visual fidelity. Therefore, the impact of changing the 'QUALITY' configuration is substantial enough to classify it as performance-sensitive."
