    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration in the Batik software project is not considered performance-sensitive because changes to the font family typically do not have a significant impact on execution time or memory consumption. While different fonts may have varying rendering times, the overall effect on system performance is minimal compared to other configurations that directly affect rendering pipelines, data processing, or resource management. Therefore, altering the font family is unlikely to cause notable variations in performance metrics."
