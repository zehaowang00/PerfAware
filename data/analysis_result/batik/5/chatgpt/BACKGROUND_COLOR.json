    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the visual presentation of graphics and does not significantly impact execution time or memory consumption. Changes to this configuration do not involve intensive computational processes or resource allocation that would lead to notable variations in system performance. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
