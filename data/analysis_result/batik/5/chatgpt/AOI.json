    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The AOI (Area of Interest) configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering performance and memory usage during the processing of SVG images. Changes in the AOI can lead to significant variations in the amount of data processed, which in turn affects execution time and memory consumption. A smaller AOI may reduce the workload and improve performance, while a larger AOI can increase the rendering time and memory footprint, making this configuration critical for optimizing performance."
