    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering process of SVG images. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in how images are processed and displayed, affecting execution time and memory consumption. For instance, increasing MAX_WIDTH may require more memory for larger images and could slow down rendering times due to increased computational load. Conversely, setting it too low may lead to suboptimal image quality and additional processing to scale images, which can also impact performance. Therefore, this configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
