    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the styling of SVG documents. While it can influence the rendering of graphics, changes to this configuration do not significantly impact core performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption. The rendering process may vary visually, but the underlying processing and resource utilization remain stable, indicating that this configuration is not performance-sensitive."
