    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'PIXEL_UNIT_TO_MILLIMETER' in the Batik software project directly affects how graphical elements are rendered and displayed. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in rendering performance, as converting pixel units to millimeters may require additional calculations and adjustments in layout and scaling. This can impact execution time, especially in scenarios involving complex graphics or large images, as well as memory consumption due to the potential increase in data handling and processing requirements. Therefore, its value change is likely to have a notable effect on overall system performance."
