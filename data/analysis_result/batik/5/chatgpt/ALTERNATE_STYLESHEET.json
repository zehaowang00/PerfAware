    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration in the Batik software project allows for the selection of different stylesheets that can significantly alter the rendering of SVG content. Changing this configuration can lead to variations in execution time due to differences in the complexity of the stylesheets being applied. More complex stylesheets may require additional processing time and memory resources, while simpler ones may execute faster. This variability in resource consumption directly impacts system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
