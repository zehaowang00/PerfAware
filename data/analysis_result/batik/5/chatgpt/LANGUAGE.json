    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration in the Batik software project can significantly affect performance because it determines how text and graphics are rendered and processed. Different languages may require different character sets and rendering techniques, which can lead to variations in execution time and memory usage. For instance, languages with complex scripts or additional characters may increase the processing overhead, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
