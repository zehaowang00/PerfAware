It determines the JPEG quality level for the image being processed, which is essential for controlling the balance between image fidelity and file size.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The `QUALITY` configuration is accessed through the `hints` map, where it is checked for its presence using the key `KEY_QUALITY`. If the quality value is provided, it is retrieved and utilized for the JPEG encoding process.\n- In the absence of a specified quality, the system defaults to a quality level of 0.75, while also logging an error message to inform the user of the unspecified quality setting.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **ImageWriterParams**: This component is responsible for holding the parameters related to image writing, including the JPEG quality setting. The quality value is set using the `setJPEGQuality` method.\n- **TranscoderOutput**: This is the output destination for the image, which is wrapped in an `OutputStreamWrapper` to handle potential stream closing exceptions gracefully.\n- **UserAgent**: This component is used to determine the pixel size in millimeters, which is then converted to inches for setting the image resolution.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `QUALITY` configuration interacts with the `ImageWriter` to dictate how the image is encoded. The writer uses the specified quality parameter when processing the image, ensuring that the output meets the desired standards set by the configuration.\n- Additionally, the configuration indirectly influences the overall image output by affecting the resolution settings, which are derived from the pixel size obtained from the `UserAgent`.\n\nThis configuration is integral to the image transcoding process, ensuring that the output quality aligns with user expectations and system requirements."
