    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering and processing of SVG images. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in the width of rendered graphics, which in turn affects memory consumption and execution time during image processing. If MAX_WIDTH is set too high, it may lead to increased memory usage and longer processing times due to larger image dimensions being handled, while a lower value may reduce resource consumption but could also result in suboptimal rendering quality. Therefore, the sensitivity of this configuration to performance metrics makes it performance-sensitive."
