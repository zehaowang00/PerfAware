    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration in the Batik software project directly impacts the rendering quality of graphics. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in the algorithms used for image processing, which in turn affects execution time and memory consumption. For instance, higher quality settings may require more complex calculations and increased memory usage to store higher resolution images, leading to longer execution times and greater resource consumption. Therefore, adjusting the 'QUALITY' setting can significantly affect overall system performance."
