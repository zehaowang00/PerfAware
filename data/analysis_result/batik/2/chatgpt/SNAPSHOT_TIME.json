    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timing of rendering and processing operations. A change in this value can lead to variations in how often snapshots are taken during image processing, which can significantly impact execution time and memory usage. If the snapshot interval is too short, it may result in excessive memory consumption due to the accumulation of snapshots, while a longer interval may lead to delays in rendering updates, affecting overall performance. Thus, adjusting 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' can have a notable effect on system performance."
