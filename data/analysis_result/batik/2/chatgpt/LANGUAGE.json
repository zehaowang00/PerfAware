    "reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration in the Batik software project can significantly affect performance because it determines the language used for rendering and processing SVG content. Different languages may have varying levels of efficiency in terms of execution time and memory usage. For instance, certain languages may require more resources for parsing or rendering, leading to increased execution time or higher memory consumption. Therefore, changing the 'LANGUAGE' configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
