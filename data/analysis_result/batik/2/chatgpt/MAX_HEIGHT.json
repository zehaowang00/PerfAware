    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'MAX_HEIGHT' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering and processing of graphics. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large images or complex vector graphics. If 'MAX_HEIGHT' is set too high, it may result in excessive memory consumption and longer processing times, as the system attempts to handle larger dimensions than necessary. Conversely, setting it too low could lead to suboptimal rendering quality or additional processing overhead to scale images. Therefore, the performance implications of adjusting 'MAX_HEIGHT' are substantial, making it a critical configuration for performance tuning."
