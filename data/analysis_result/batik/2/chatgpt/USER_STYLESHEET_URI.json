    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration in the Batik software project is primarily used to specify the location of user-defined stylesheets for SVG rendering. While it can affect the appearance of rendered graphics, it does not significantly impact the underlying performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption. Changes to this configuration may lead to variations in rendering styles but do not alter the core processing or resource utilization of the system, thus classifying it as non-performance-sensitive."
