    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is accessed and processed. When this configuration is set to indexed, it can significantly reduce the time complexity of data retrieval operations, leading to faster execution times. Conversely, if set to a non-indexed state, the system may resort to linear searches, which can drastically increase execution time and memory consumption, especially with large datasets. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
