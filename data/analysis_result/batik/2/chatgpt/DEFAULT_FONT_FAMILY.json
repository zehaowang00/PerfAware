    "reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the rendering of text and graphics. While changing the font family may influence the visual output and potentially the rendering time for complex documents, it does not lead to significant variations in execution time or memory consumption across the system. The impact of this configuration change is generally minimal and does not affect the overall performance of the system in a substantial way."
