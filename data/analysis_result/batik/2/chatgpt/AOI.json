    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The AOI (Area of Interest) configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of vector graphics. Changes in the AOI can lead to significant variations in the amount of data processed during rendering, which in turn affects execution time and memory consumption. A larger AOI may require more resources to process additional graphical elements, while a smaller AOI can reduce the workload, leading to faster execution and lower memory usage. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
