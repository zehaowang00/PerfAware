    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the presentation layer of the application, allowing for different styles to be applied without altering the underlying data processing or rendering logic. Changes to this configuration do not significantly impact execution time or memory consumption, as the stylesheet loading and application process is typically lightweight and does not involve intensive computations. Therefore, variations in this configuration are unlikely to cause notable performance variations in the overall system."
