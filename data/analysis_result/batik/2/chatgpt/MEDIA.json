    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'MEDIA' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how media resources are handled during rendering. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time due to the processing overhead associated with different media formats and sizes. For instance, if the configuration is set to handle high-resolution images or complex media types, it can substantially increase memory consumption and processing time, affecting overall system performance. Conversely, optimizing this configuration for lower-resolution media can reduce resource usage and improve execution speed. Therefore, the impact of changing the 'MEDIA' configuration is critical to the performance of the system."
