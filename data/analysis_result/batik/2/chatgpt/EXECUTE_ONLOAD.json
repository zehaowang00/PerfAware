    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences when and how resources are loaded and executed. If this configuration is set to execute on load, it can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially if large resources are involved. Conversely, if it is not set to execute on load, resources may be loaded on demand, potentially improving performance by reducing initial load times and memory usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
