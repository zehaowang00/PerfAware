    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The AOI (Area of Interest) configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of vector graphics. Changes in the AOI can lead to significant variations in the amount of data processed and the complexity of the rendering tasks. A smaller AOI may reduce the amount of graphical data that needs to be rendered, thus decreasing execution time and memory usage. Conversely, a larger AOI can increase the workload, leading to longer execution times and higher memory consumption. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
