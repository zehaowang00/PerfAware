    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering quality of graphics and images. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly when processing high-resolution images or complex vector graphics. For instance, setting a higher quality level may require more computational resources and memory to handle the increased detail, resulting in longer processing times and potentially impacting overall system performance. Conversely, lowering the quality can reduce resource usage and improve performance, indicating that this configuration is indeed performance-sensitive."
