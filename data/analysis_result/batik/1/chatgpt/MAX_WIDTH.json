    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering and processing of SVG images. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in how graphics are scaled and displayed, which in turn affects memory consumption and execution time. For instance, setting a lower MAX_WIDTH may result in more frequent reflows and repaints during rendering, while a higher value could lead to increased memory usage as larger images are processed. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
