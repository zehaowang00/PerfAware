    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences when and how resources are loaded and executed in the application. A change in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, particularly if resources are loaded synchronously versus asynchronously. If set to execute on load, it can increase memory consumption and delay rendering times, especially for large SVG files or complex graphics, thereby significantly impacting overall system performance. Conversely, if disabled, it may improve performance by deferring resource loading, but at the cost of potential delays in rendering when those resources are finally needed. Therefore, the value change of this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and memory usage."
