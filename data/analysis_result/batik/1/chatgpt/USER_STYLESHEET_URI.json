    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration in the Batik software project is primarily used to specify a URI for a user-defined stylesheet. While it may influence the rendering of graphics or the appearance of output, changing this configuration does not significantly impact core system performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption. The stylesheet is applied during the rendering process, and variations in its URI would not lead to notable variations in performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
