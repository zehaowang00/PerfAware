    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering process of SVG images. A change in the WIDTH value can lead to significant variations in the amount of memory allocated for rendering and the time taken to process and display graphics. If the WIDTH is set too high, it may cause excessive memory consumption and longer execution times due to increased computational overhead, while a lower WIDTH may improve performance but could lead to suboptimal rendering quality. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
