    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts how data is accessed and processed. When the indexing method is altered, it can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially for operations involving large datasets or complex rendering tasks. An indexed approach typically allows for faster lookups and retrievals, while a non-indexed approach may result in increased memory consumption and slower performance due to the need for more extensive searches through data structures. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance fluctuations."
