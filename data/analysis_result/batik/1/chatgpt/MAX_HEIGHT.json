    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'MAX_HEIGHT' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the rendering and processing of graphical elements. A change in 'MAX_HEIGHT' can lead to significant variations in memory usage and execution time, especially when dealing with large images or complex SVG files. If the maximum height is set too high, it may result in excessive memory consumption, leading to slower performance or even application crashes. Conversely, setting it too low could cause additional processing overhead as the system may need to perform extra calculations to fit content within the specified height, thus impacting overall rendering time."
