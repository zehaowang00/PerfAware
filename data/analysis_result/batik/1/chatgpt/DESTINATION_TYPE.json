    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration in the Batik software project determines how output is generated, which can significantly affect performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage. For instance, changing the destination type from a simple file output to a more complex rendering process can lead to increased resource consumption and longer processing times. This sensitivity is particularly pronounced in scenarios involving large graphics or complex SVG processing, where the choice of destination can lead to substantial variations in performance."
