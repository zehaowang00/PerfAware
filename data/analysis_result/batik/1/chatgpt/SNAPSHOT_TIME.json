    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the frequency and timing of memory snapshots taken during execution. A lower SNAPSHOT_TIME can lead to more frequent memory snapshots, which can significantly increase the overhead due to additional processing and memory usage, thereby affecting execution time. Conversely, a higher SNAPSHOT_TIME may reduce this overhead but can lead to increased memory consumption if snapshots are not taken frequently enough to manage memory effectively. This variability in execution time and memory consumption based on the configuration value indicates its performance sensitivity."
