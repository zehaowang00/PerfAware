    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration in the Batik software project primarily affects the visual presentation of rendered graphics rather than the underlying processing logic or resource utilization. Changes to the background color do not significantly impact execution time or memory consumption, as rendering operations for color changes are typically lightweight and handled efficiently by the graphics subsystem. Therefore, this configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
