    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY' in the Batik software project is not performance-sensitive because changes to the font family primarily affect rendering and display aesthetics rather than core processing tasks. While different fonts may have slight variations in rendering time, these differences are generally negligible compared to other performance-critical configurations such as memory allocation, data processing algorithms, or rendering pipelines. Therefore, altering the font family does not lead to significant variations in execution time or memory consumption that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
