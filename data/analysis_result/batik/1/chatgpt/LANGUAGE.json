    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration in the Batik software project can significantly impact performance because it determines the language used for rendering graphics and processing commands. Different languages may have varying levels of efficiency in execution, which can lead to notable differences in execution time and memory consumption. For instance, if the configuration is set to a language that is less optimized for the tasks performed by Batik, it could result in slower processing and increased resource usage, thereby affecting overall system performance."
