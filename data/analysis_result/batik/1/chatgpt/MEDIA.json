    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MEDIA configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how media content is processed and rendered. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when handling large media files or complex graphics. For instance, altering the compression settings or the quality of media can impact memory consumption and processing speed, resulting in noticeable performance degradation or improvement during rendering tasks. Therefore, any adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial effect on overall system performance."
