    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how scripts are processed and executed within the rendering pipeline. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, particularly when handling complex SVG documents or when scripts are involved in rendering. If the origin of scripts is constrained, it may limit the resources available for script execution, potentially leading to increased memory consumption or longer execution times due to additional checks or restrictions. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
