The width and height of the output image can be influenced by the dimensions of the AOI, allowing for flexible rendering based on user input.\n\n5. **Default Behavior**:\n   - If no AOI is specified, the system defaults to using the entire document area, represented by a rectangle that spans the full width and height of the output. This ensures that the transcoding process can still proceed even in the absence of a specific AOI.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe AOI configuration is integral to the SVG transcoding process, providing a mechanism for focused rendering based on user-defined areas. Its interactions with the hints map, transformation calculations, and other configuration parameters enable a flexible and dynamic approach to handling SVG documents, ensuring that the output meets specific visual requirements."

Below are the key configuration-related aspects:\\n\\n1. **Area of Interest (AOI)**:\\n   - The code checks for the presence of a key `KEY_AOI` in the `hints` map. If it exists, it retrieves the associated `Rectangle2D` object, which defines a specific area of interest for the transcoding process.\\n   - The transformation matrix (`Px`) is calculated based on the width and height of the AOI relative to the desired output dimensions, allowing for scaling and translation to fit the AOI within the output image.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic State**:\\n   - The code also checks for a `KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD` hint, which indicates whether the document should be treated as dynamic. This affects how the document is processed and whether scripts should be loaded and executed.\\n\\n3. **Scaling to Page**:\\n   - In the `setImageSize` method, the code checks for a `KEY_SCALE_TO_PAGE` hint. If set to `false`, it uses the document's original dimensions or the AOI dimensions to set the image size, bypassing any scaling that would normally occur.\\n\\n4. **Width and Height**:\\n   - The width and height for the transcoding output are derived from the hints if specified, allowing for flexible output dimensions based on user-defined parameters.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe configuration parameters play a crucial role in determining how the SVG document is processed, particularly in terms of scaling, dynamic behavior, and specific areas of interest for rendering.

Below is a detailed overview of its purpose and interactions within the system:\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - The AOI configuration is designed to specify a particular rectangular area within the SVG document that should be focused on during the transcoding process. This allows for selective rendering of content, which can be essential for applications that require specific visual outputs.\\n\\n2. **Functionality**:\\n   - The configuration is accessed through a `hints` map, where the presence of the key `KEY_AOI` indicates that an AOI has been defined. If present, the associated `Rectangle2D` object is retrieved, which contains the dimensions and position of the area of interest.\\n\\n3. **Transformation Matrix Calculation**:\\n   - Upon retrieval of the AOI, the code computes a transformation matrix (`Px`) that adjusts the coordinates of the AOI to fit the desired output dimensions. This involves scaling and translating the AOI to ensure it is rendered correctly within the output image.\\n\\n4. **Integration with Other Components**:\\n   - The AOI configuration interacts with other parts of the system, such as the dynamic state of the document (controlled by `KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD`) and the overall image size settings (managed by the `setImageSize` method).

Additionally, there should be a clearer explanation of how the growth of memory usage and execution time scales with different values of `_k` and `g`, particularly in edge cases.
