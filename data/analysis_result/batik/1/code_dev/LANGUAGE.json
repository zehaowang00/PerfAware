This configuration is accessed through the `TranscodingHints` mechanism, which serves as a key-value store for various transcoding parameters.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `LANGUAGE` configuration is to retrieve the user-specified language for transcoding operations. If a language is defined in the `TranscodingHints` using the key `KEY_LANGUAGE`, it will be returned by the `getLanguages()` method. If no specific language is set, the method defaults to returning the superclass's implementation, which typically provides a standard language setting (in this case, English).\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SVGAbstractTranscoder**: This is the main class that utilizes the `LANGUAGE` configuration. It contains a `hints` map that holds various transcoding options.\n- **TranscodingHints**: This is the configuration mechanism that stores the `LANGUAGE` setting as a key-value pair.\n- **KEY_LANGUAGE**: This constant acts as the key to access the user-defined language within the `hints` map.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `getLanguages()` method checks for the presence of the `KEY_LANGUAGE` in the `hints` map. If found, it retrieves and returns the corresponding language value. If not found, it calls the superclass method to obtain a default language setting. This interaction ensures that the transcoder can adapt to user preferences while maintaining a fallback option.\n\nOverall, the `LANGUAGE` configuration is essential for customizing the transcoding process based on user language preferences, facilitating a more tailored experience."
