This configuration plays a crucial role in allowing users to specify custom styles for SVG content during the transcoding process.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SVGAbstractTranscoder**: This class serves as the base for transcoding SVG files. It contains a `hints` map that stores various transcoding options, including the user stylesheet URI.\n- **TranscodingHints**: This is a collection of hints that can influence the transcoding process. The `USER_STYLESHEET_URI` is one of the keys in this collection.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. The method `getUserStyleSheetURI()` checks the `hints` map for the presence of a value associated with the `KEY_USER_STYLESHEET_URI`.\n2. If a value is found, it returns this URI, allowing the transcoder to apply the specified stylesheet.\n3. If no user stylesheet is specified (i.e., the value is `null`), the method delegates to the superclass's implementation of `getUserStyleSheetURI()`, which may return a default stylesheet or `null`.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- This configuration interacts directly with the transcoding process by influencing how SVG content is rendered based on the provided stylesheet.\n- It is dependent on the `hints` map, which must be populated with the appropriate key-value pairs before invoking this method.\n\nOverall, the `USER_STYLESHEET_URI` configuration facilitates customization of SVG rendering, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the transcoding system."
