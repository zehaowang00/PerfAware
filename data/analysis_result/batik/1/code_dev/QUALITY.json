This configuration is accessed through a `hints` map, which allows for flexible quality settings depending on the context in which the image is being processed.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `QUALITY` configuration is to specify the compression quality of the JPEG image being generated. If a quality value is provided in the `hints` map under the key `KEY_QUALITY`, it is used directly; otherwise, a default value of 0.75 is applied. This ensures that there is always a quality setting in place, preventing potential errors during image transcoding.\n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n- **hints**: A map that holds various configuration parameters, including the quality setting.\n- **KEY_QUALITY**: A constant that serves as the key to retrieve the quality value from the `hints` map.\n- **TranscoderException**: An exception thrown if the quality is not specified and an error occurs.\n- **ImageWriterParams**: An object that encapsulates the parameters for writing the image, including the quality setting.\n- **OutputStreamWrapper**: A wrapper around the output stream that manages exceptions related to stream closures.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n1. **Quality Retrieval**: The method first checks if the `hints` map contains a quality setting. This interaction allows for dynamic configuration based on the context in which the method is called.\n2. **Error Handling**: If the quality is not specified, an error is logged, and a default value is used, ensuring robustness in the image writing process.\n3. **Image Writing**: The quality setting is passed to the `ImageWriterParams`, which is then used by the `ImageWriter` to write the image to the output stream. This establishes a direct link between the configuration and the image output process.\n\nOverall, the `QUALITY` configuration is integral to the image transcoding process, providing flexibility and ensuring that images are generated with a specified or default quality level."
