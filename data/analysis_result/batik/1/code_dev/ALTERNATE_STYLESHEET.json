This functionality is encapsulated within the `getAlternateStyleSheet()` method.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to allow the user agent to specify and return an alternate style sheet title when available. This is particularly useful for applications that support multiple styles or themes, enabling dynamic changes in the presentation layer based on user preferences or specific contexts.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method first attempts to retrieve the alternate style sheet title from a `hints` map using the key `KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET`.\n- If a value is found (i.e., the alternate style sheet title is set), it is returned.\n- If no alternate style sheet title is present in the `hints`, the method falls back to the default implementation provided by the superclass, ensuring that there is always a valid return value.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **hints Map**: This is a key component that stores various configuration settings, including the alternate style sheet title. It is crucial for the method's ability to customize the style sheet based on user-defined settings.\n- **KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET**: This constant serves as the key to access the specific configuration value within the `hints` map.\n- **Superclass Implementation**: The method relies on the superclass's `getAlternateStyleSheet()` method as a fallback mechanism, indicating a dependency on the parent class's implementation for default behavior.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThis configuration interacts with the user interface layer by providing the necessary style sheet title that can affect the rendering of content. It allows for flexibility in presentation, enabling different styles to be applied based on user preferences or application states. The retrieval of the alternate style sheet title can influence how content is displayed, thereby enhancing user experience.\n\nOverall, the `ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET` configuration plays a vital role in managing the visual aspects of the application, ensuring that users can have a tailored experience based on their style preferences."
