The operations involved, such as checking for the existence of a key in a map and iterating over a string with a tokenizer, are not time-intensive or memory-intensive. The use of `LinkedList` for storage does not significantly impact performance in this context, as the method is unlikely to be called frequently enough or with sufficiently large data to cause substantial performance variations."
