    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration in the Batik software project primarily specifies the location of a user-defined stylesheet. While changing this URI may influence the rendering of SVG content, it does not directly impact core performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption in a significant manner. The performance impact is generally minimal and dependent on the complexity of the stylesheet itself rather than the configuration value. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
