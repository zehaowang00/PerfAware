    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration in the Batik software project determines how output is rendered, which can significantly impact performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage. For instance, switching from a file-based output to a stream-based output can lead to variations in resource allocation and processing time, especially with large graphics or complex rendering tasks. This sensitivity to configuration changes can result in notable performance differences, making it a performance-sensitive option."
