    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rendering and processing of graphical elements. Changes in the WIDTH value can lead to significant variations in the execution time, especially when dealing with large images or complex SVG files. A wider width may require more memory for buffering and can increase the time taken for layout calculations and rendering, while a narrower width might reduce memory consumption but could also lead to increased processing time if elements need to be resized or reflowed. Therefore, variations in this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
