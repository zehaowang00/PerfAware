    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences how data is accessed and manipulated within the system. If this configuration is set to indexed, it can significantly enhance the performance of operations that involve searching and retrieving data, leading to reduced execution times. Conversely, if it is not indexed, the system may resort to less efficient methods, resulting in increased memory consumption and longer processing times. Therefore, changes to the 'INDEXED' configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
