    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering quality of graphics. Changes in this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially when processing complex SVG images. Higher quality settings typically require more computational resources and memory for rendering, which can result in increased execution time and potentially lead to performance bottlenecks in scenarios with large or numerous graphic files. Therefore, the sensitivity of this configuration to performance metrics classifies it as performance-sensitive."
