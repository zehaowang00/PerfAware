    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering and processing of SVG images. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and execution time, particularly when dealing with large or complex SVG files. If the MAX_HEIGHT is set too low, it may result in excessive clipping or rendering errors, while setting it too high can lead to increased memory usage and slower performance due to the need to handle larger graphical data. Therefore, this configuration is deemed performance-sensitive as it can substantially impact the overall performance of the system."
