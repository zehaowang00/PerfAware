    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how text rendering is handled within the system. Changing the font family can lead to variations in rendering time, as different fonts may have different complexities in terms of glyph rendering and layout calculations. Additionally, certain fonts may require more memory for their data structures, impacting overall memory consumption. This can result in significant variations in execution time and resource usage, especially when rendering large amounts of text or complex graphics."
