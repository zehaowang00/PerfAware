    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration in the Batik software project can significantly affect performance due to the way different languages may influence the parsing and rendering of SVG content. Different language settings can lead to variations in how text is processed, which can impact execution time and memory usage, particularly in applications that handle large amounts of text or complex SVG graphics. Additionally, language-specific libraries or resources may have different performance characteristics, further contributing to the overall performance sensitivity of this configuration."
