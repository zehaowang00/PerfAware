    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'MAX_WIDTH' configuration in the Batik software project directly influences the rendering and processing of graphics. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when handling large images or complex vector graphics. If the maximum width is set too high, it may cause excessive memory consumption and slow down the rendering process, while a lower value may lead to quicker processing but could also result in loss of detail or quality in the output. Therefore, adjustments to 'MAX_WIDTH' can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
