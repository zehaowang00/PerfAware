    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'MEDIA' configuration in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how media content is processed and rendered. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when handling large media files or complex graphics. For instance, altering the media resolution or format can impact memory consumption and processing speed, resulting in slower rendering times or increased resource usage. Therefore, any adjustments to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
