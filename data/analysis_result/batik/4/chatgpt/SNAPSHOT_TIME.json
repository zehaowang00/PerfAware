    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' in the Batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timing of rendering operations and memory management during image processing. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in execution time, as it determines how frequently snapshots of the rendering context are taken. If the snapshot interval is too short, it can lead to excessive memory consumption and increased processing overhead, while a longer interval may result in delays in rendering updates. Therefore, adjustments to 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
