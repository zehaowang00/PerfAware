It is accessed through a `hints` map, which allows the system to retrieve the desired quality level for the image encoding process.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `QUALITY` configuration is to specify the compression quality of the JPEG image being processed. This allows users to control the trade-off between image fidelity and file size, enabling flexibility based on application requirements.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Retrieval of Quality Setting**: The method checks if the `hints` map contains a key for `KEY_QUALITY`. If it does, it retrieves the corresponding quality value as a `Float`. If the key is absent, it defaults to a quality value of `0.75f` and logs an error indicating that the quality was unspecified.\n\n2. **Integration with Image Writing**: The retrieved quality value is then set in the `ImageWriterParams` object, which is responsible for configuring the parameters for the JPEG writer. This integration ensures that the specified quality is applied during the image writing process.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **Hints Map**: The `hints` map is a critical dependency as it provides the mechanism for external configuration of the image quality.\n- **ImageWriterParams**: This component is essential for encapsulating the quality setting and other parameters that influence how the image is written.\n- **TranscoderOutput**: This is the output destination for the image, which interacts with the quality configuration during the writing process.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\nThe `QUALITY` configuration interacts with the `OutputStreamWrapper` to ensure that the output stream is properly managed, and it works alongside the `ImageWriterRegistry` to obtain the appropriate image writer for JPEG format. The overall flow involves checking for quality settings, applying them to the image writing parameters, and then executing the writing process, ensuring that the final output adheres to the specified quality level.\n\nThis configuration is integral to the image transcoding process, allowing for customizable output based on user-defined quality settings."
