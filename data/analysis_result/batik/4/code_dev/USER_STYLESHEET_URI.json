This configuration plays a crucial role in customizing the rendering of SVG content by allowing users to specify their own stylesheets, which can modify the appearance of the SVG elements during transcoding.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SVGAbstractTranscoder**: This class serves as the base for transcoding SVG files. It holds a collection of hints, including the `USER_STYLESHEET_URI`.\n- **TranscodingHints**: This is a map-like structure that stores various hints for the transcoding process, including user stylesheets.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. The method `getUserStyleSheetURI()` first attempts to retrieve the stylesheet URI from the `hints` map using the key `KEY_USER_STYLESHEET_URI`.\n2. If a valid URI is found, it is returned, allowing the transcoder to apply the specified stylesheet.\n3. If no user stylesheet is specified (i.e., the retrieved value is `null`), the method falls back to the superclass implementation, which may return a default stylesheet or `null`.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- This configuration interacts with the broader transcoding process by influencing how SVG content is styled. It allows for flexibility and customization based on user preferences.\n- The method's reliance on the superclass indicates a layered approach to configuration, where default behaviors can be overridden by user-defined settings.\n\nOverall, the `USER_STYLESHEET_URI` configuration enhances the system's capability to adapt SVG rendering according to user specifications, thereby enriching the user experience."
