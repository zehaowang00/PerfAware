            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: The `computeAllowedScripts` method primarily performs string parsing and list population operations, which are not inherently time-intensive or memory-heavy. The use of `StringTokenizer` and `LinkedList` for parsing a comma-separated string of allowed script types does not introduce significant performance variations, as these operations are generally efficient and do not scale poorly with typical input sizes. The impact on system performance is minor, as it does not involve extensive computations or large memory allocations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
