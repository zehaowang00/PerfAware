This ensures that the image does not exceed a specified maximum height, which can be critical for maintaining layout consistency and visual integrity in the application.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **hints Map**: This is a collection that stores various configuration parameters, including `MAX_HEIGHT`. The method checks if `MAX_HEIGHT` is defined in this map and retrieves its value.\n- **Global Variables**: The method modifies global variables `width` and `height`, which represent the current dimensions of the image. These variables are adjusted based on the value of `MAX_HEIGHT` if it is applicable.\n\n### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `setImageSize` method interacts with other parts of the system by taking `docWidth` and `docHeight` as parameters, which represent the dimensions of the document containing the image. The method calculates new dimensions for the image based on these document dimensions and the constraints provided by `MAX_HEIGHT`.\n- If the current height of the image exceeds `imgMaxHeight`, the method recalculates both the width and height of the image to maintain the aspect ratio while adhering to the maximum height constraint.\n\nIn summary, `MAX_HEIGHT` serves as a configuration parameter that influences how images are sized within the system, ensuring they remain within defined limits while interacting with document dimensions and other configuration hints."
