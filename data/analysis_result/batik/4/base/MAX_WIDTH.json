The method modifies global variables `width` and `height` based on the following configuration parameters:\\n\\n1. **Image Size Hints**:\\n   - **KEY_WIDTH**: If present, it sets the image width.\\n   - **KEY_HEIGHT**: If present, it sets the image height.\\n\\n2. **Maximum Size Constraints**:\\n   - **KEY_MAX_WIDTH**: If present, it limits the image width to this maximum value.\\n   - **KEY_MAX_HEIGHT**: If present, it limits the image height to this maximum value.\\n\\n### Logic Flow:\\n- The method first checks for specific width and height hints. If both are provided, it directly sets the `width` and `height`.\\n- If only one dimension is provided, it calculates the other dimension based on the document's aspect ratio.\\n- Finally, it checks if the calculated dimensions exceed any specified maximum dimensions and adjusts them accordingly.\\n\\nThis method ensures that the image dimensions are set within the constraints provided by the hints and the document's dimensions.\\n\\nThe following methods were found to be unclear in the performance analysis context.\\nHere is the code context to aid further examination:\\n\\nMethod Name: setImageSize\\nMethod Code:\\n/**\\n* Sets document size according to the hints.\\n* Global variables width and height are modified.\\n*\\n* @param docWidth Width of the document.\\n* @param docHeight Height of the document.\\n*/\\n    protected void setImageSize(float docWidth, float docHeight) {\\n\\n        // Compute the image's width and height according the hints\\n        float imgWidth = -1;\\n        if (hints.containsKey(KEY_WIDTH)) {\\n            imgWidth = (Float) hints.get(KEY_WIDTH);\\n        }\\n        float imgHeight = -1;\\n        if (hints.containsKey(KEY_HEIGHT)) {\\n            imgHeight = (Float) hints.get(KEY_HEIGHT);\\n        }\\n\\n        if (imgWidth > 0 && imgHeight > 0) {\\n            width = imgWidth;\\n            height = imgHeight;\\n        } else if (imgHeight > 0) {\\n            width = (docWidth * imgHeight) / docHeight;\\n            height = imgHeight;\\n        } else if (imgWidth > 0) {\\n            width = imgWidth;\\n            height = (docHeight * imgWidth) / docWidth;\\n        } else {\\n            width = docWidth;\\n            height = docHeight;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Limit image size according to the maximuxm size hints.\\n        float imgMaxWidth = -1;\\n        if (hints.containsKey(KEY_MAX_WIDTH)) {\\n            imgMaxWidth = (Float) hints.get(KEY_MAX_WIDTH);\\n        }\\n        float imgMaxHeight = -1;\\n        if (hints.containsKey(KEY_MAX_HEIGHT)) {\\n            imgMaxHeight = (Float) hints.get(KEY_MAX_HEIGHT);\\n        }\\n\\n        if ((imgMaxHeight > 0) && (height > imgMaxHeight)) {\\n            width = (docWidth * imgMaxHeight) / docHeight;\\n            height = imgMaxHeight;\\n        }\\n        if ((imgMaxWidth > 0) && (width > imgMaxWidth)) {\\n            width = imgMaxWidth;\\n            height = (docHeight * imgMaxWidth) / docWidth;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n/**\\n* Sets document size according to the hints.\\n* Global variables width and height are modified.\\n*\\n* @param docWidth Width of the document.\\n* @param docHeight Height of the document.\\n*/\\n    protected void setImageSize(float docWidth, float docHeight) {\\n        // Check hint to know if scaling is really needed\\n        Boolean scaleToPage = (Boolean)hints.get(KEY_SCALE_TO_PAGE);\\n        if(scaleToPage != null && !scaleToPage) {\\n            float w = docWidth;\\n            float h = docHeight;\\n            if (hints.containsKey(KEY_AOI)) {\\n                Rectangle2D aoi = (Rectangle2D)hints.get(KEY_AOI);\\n                w = (float)aoi.getWidth();\\n                h = (float)aoi.getHeight();\\n            }\\n            super.setImageSize(w, h);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n--- Summary by Developer ---\\n### Configuration Summary for `MAX_WIDTH`\\n\\nThe `MAX_WIDTH` configuration parameter plays a crucial role in managing the dimensions of images within the system. It is utilized within the `setImageSize` method to enforce constraints on the width of images based on provided hints. \\n\\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\\n- **Purpose**: The `MAX_WIDTH` configuration is intended to limit the maximum allowable width of an image, ensuring that images do not exceed a specified size, which can be important for maintaining layout consistency and preventing overflow in user interfaces or document displays.\\n\\n#### Key Components:\\n- **Method Involvement**: \\n  - The `setImageSize` method checks for the presence of `KEY_MAX_WIDTH` in the `hints` map. If it exists, the method retrieves its value and uses it to potentially adjust the global `width` variable.\\n  \\n- **Dependencies**:\\n  - The method relies on the `hints` map, which is expected to contain various configuration keys, including `KEY_MAX_WIDTH`, `KEY_WIDTH`, and `KEY_HEIGHT`. The presence and values of these keys directly influence how the image dimensions are set.\\n  \\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\\n- The `setImageSize` method interacts with other configuration parameters such as `KEY_WIDTH` and `KEY_HEIGHT`, which determine the desired dimensions of the image. The logic within the method ensures that the final dimensions of the image respect the maximum constraints defined by `MAX_WIDTH` and other related parameters.\\n- The method also modifies global variables `width` and `height`, which may be used by other components of the system to render or display the image correctly.\\n\\nIn summary, the `MAX_WIDTH` configuration is integral to controlling the image sizing process, ensuring that images adhere to specified maximum dimensions while allowing for flexibility based on other provided hints.\"}"
