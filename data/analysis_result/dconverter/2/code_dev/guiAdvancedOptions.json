When `guiAdvancedOptions` is set to true, the application presents advanced options to the user, allowing for more detailed configuration. Conversely, if set to false, the application defaults to a simpler interface, hiding more complex settings.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **`Arguments` Class**: This class encapsulates various user preferences, including `guiAdvancedOptions`. It serves as the data structure that holds the configuration values.\n- **`preferenceStore`**: This is the source from which the application retrieves user preferences, including the `Arguments` instance.\n- **Radio Buttons (`rbOptAdvanced` and `rbOptSimple`)**: These UI components represent the two modes of operation (advanced and simple). The state of these buttons is directly influenced by the value of `guiAdvancedOptions`.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `loadPrefs()` method is responsible for initializing the GUI based on the stored preferences. It checks if the `Arguments` object is available and then sets the state of the radio buttons according to the value of `guiAdvancedOptions`.\n- This configuration interacts with other settings and preferences, as the choice of advanced or simple options may affect how other configurations are displayed or utilized within the application. \n\nIn summary, `guiAdvancedOptions` is essential for tailoring the user experience based on user preferences, providing flexibility in how settings are presented and managed in the application."
