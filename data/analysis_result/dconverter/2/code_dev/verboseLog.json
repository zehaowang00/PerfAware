It provides developers and users with insights into the execution flow and any issues that arise, facilitating easier debugging and understanding of the system's behavior.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- Within the `onFinished` method, the `verboseLog` flag is checked before printing the overall log of the execution and any encountered exceptions. If `verboseLog` is set to true, the system outputs:\n  - A summary log of the execution.\n  - Detailed error messages and stack traces for each exception encountered during the job execution.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The `verboseLog` configuration relies on the `args` object, which presumably contains various runtime arguments passed to the application. This indicates that the logging behavior can be controlled at runtime based on user input or configuration settings.\n- The configuration interacts with the exception handling mechanism, ensuring that when errors occur, the relevant information is printed only if verbose logging is enabled.
