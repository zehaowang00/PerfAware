    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' directly impacts the image processing performance within the 'dconverter' software project. Enabling PNG crushing can significantly reduce the file size of PNG images, which in turn can lead to reduced memory consumption and faster execution times during image handling and conversion processes. If this option is toggled, it can result in notable variations in processing time and resource utilization, thereby classifying it as performance-sensitive."
