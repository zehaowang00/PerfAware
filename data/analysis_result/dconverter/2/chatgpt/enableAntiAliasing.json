    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project directly influences the rendering quality of graphics. Enabling anti-aliasing typically requires additional processing power and memory to smooth out jagged edges in images, which can significantly increase execution time and memory consumption. This increased resource usage can lead to performance degradation, particularly in scenarios where rendering speed is critical, such as real-time graphics processing or high-resolution image conversion. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
