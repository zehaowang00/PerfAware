    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'outputCompressionMode' configuration in the dconverter software project directly influences how data is processed and stored. Changes in this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large datasets. For instance, enabling higher levels of compression may reduce the output size, thus saving disk space and potentially speeding up I/O operations, but it may also increase CPU usage and processing time due to the additional overhead of compression algorithms. Conversely, disabling compression may lead to faster processing but at the cost of increased storage requirements. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably impact both execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
