    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the conversion process of images to the WebP format. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, as different settings may optimize or degrade the efficiency of the conversion algorithm. Additionally, depending on the configuration values, memory consumption can also vary, particularly if the process involves buffering or caching strategies that are sensitive to the configuration. Therefore, any modifications to 'postConvertWebp' can substantially impact the overall performance of the system."
