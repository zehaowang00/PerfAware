    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how numerical values are processed and represented. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, especially in scenarios involving large datasets or complex calculations. For instance, different rounding methods can result in different computational paths, affecting both CPU cycles and memory usage. Moreover, if the rounding method alters the precision of calculations, it can lead to additional overhead in error correction or adjustments, further impacting overall system performance."
