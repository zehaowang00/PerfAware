    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project primarily controls the behavior of the application in the event of an error during execution. While it may affect the flow of execution (i.e., whether the application stops or continues processing after encountering an error), it does not directly influence resource consumption metrics such as execution time or memory usage in a significant manner. Therefore, changes to this configuration are unlikely to cause notable variations in overall system performance."
