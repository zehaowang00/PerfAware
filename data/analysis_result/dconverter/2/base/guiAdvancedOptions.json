This configuration allows users to toggle between advanced and simple GUI options, enhancing the user experience based on individual preferences.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The configuration is primarily managed through the `loadPrefs()` method, which retrieves user preferences from a `preferenceStore`. It checks if the `Arguments` object is not null and then sets the state of the radio buttons (`rbOptAdvanced` and `rbOptSimple`) based on the value of `args.guiAdvancedOptions`.\n- If `args.guiAdvancedOptions` is true, the advanced options are selected, enabling users to access more detailed settings. Conversely, if false, the simple options are activated, streamlining the interface for users who may prefer a less complex view.\n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n1. **UI Components**:\n   - `rbOptAdvanced`: A radio button that, when selected, indicates that the advanced options should be displayed.\n   - `rbOptSimple`: A radio button that, when selected, indicates that the simple options should be displayed.\n\n2. **Arguments Object**:\n   - The `Arguments` object contains various user preferences, including the `guiAdvancedOptions` boolean, which directly influences the UI configuration.\n\n3. **Preference Store**:\n   - The `preferenceStore` is a storage mechanism that holds user preferences, allowing the application to persist settings across sessions.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `loadPrefs()` method interacts with other configuration settings by ensuring that the appropriate UI elements are displayed based on user preferences. This method is part of a larger initialization process that configures various aspects of the application, such as source and destination paths, scaling options, and platform settings.\n- The method `setPlatformToogles(Set<EPlatform> platformSet)` is also invoked within the broader context of loading preferences, indicating that the selected platforms may depend on the advanced options being displayed.\n\nIn summary, the `guiAdvancedOptions` configuration is essential for tailoring the user interface to meet the needs of different users, facilitating a more personalized and efficient interaction with the application."
