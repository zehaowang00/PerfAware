            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Configuration Purpose and Interaction Summary\n\nThe configuration named `filesToProcess` plays a crucial role in the execution of a file conversion process within the system. It serves as a list of files that are intended to be processed by various platform converters, which are determined by the `Arguments` class.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Arguments Class**: \n   - The `filesToProcess` is a key variable within the `Arguments` class, which encapsulates various configuration settings that dictate how the conversion process should be executed.\n   - Other important flags in `Arguments` include `platform`, `dst`, `clearDirBeforeConvert`, and `iosCreateImagesetFolders`, which influence the behavior of the conversion and cleanup processes.\n\n2. **Clean Method**:\n   - The `clean` method utilizes `filesToProcess` to determine which directories to delete based on the specified platforms and whether to create image set folders for iOS. This method ensures that the environment is prepared for the conversion process by removing any previous outputs that might interfere with the new conversion.\n\n3. **Execute Method**:\n   - The `execute` method is responsible for starting the conversion process. It checks if `filesToProcess` is empty before proceeding. If there are files to process, it initializes converters and post-processors based on the platforms specified in `Arguments`.\n   - It also verifies the existence of each file in `filesToProcess`, ensuring that only valid files are processed.\n\n4. **WorkerHandler**:\n   - The `WorkerHandler` class is used to manage the execution of conversion jobs concurrently. It interacts with the `filesToProcess` by processing each file in the list and handling the results of the conversion.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `filesToProcess` configuration interacts closely with the platform converters, which are responsible for converting the files into the desired formats based on the selected platforms.\n- The configuration also affects how the system cleans up previous outputs and prepares for new conversions, ensuring that the conversion process is streamlined and efficient.\n\nIn summary, the `filesToProcess` configuration is integral to the file conversion workflow, influencing both the preparation and execution phases of the process. It interacts with multiple components, including the `Arguments` class, the `clean` and `execute` methods, and the `WorkerHandler`, to ensure a coherent and effective conversion operation."
