    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'outputCompressionMode' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project directly influences the amount of data processed and stored. Changing the compression mode can lead to significant variations in execution time, as different modes may require varying levels of computational resources and time to compress or decompress data. Additionally, it can affect memory consumption, as certain compression algorithms may use more memory to achieve higher compression ratios. Therefore, this configuration is classified as performance-sensitive due to its substantial impact on overall system performance."
