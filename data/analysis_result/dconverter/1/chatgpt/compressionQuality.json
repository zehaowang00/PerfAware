    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration in the dconverter software directly influences the algorithm's efficiency in handling data compression. A higher compression quality typically results in better data reduction but requires more processing power and time, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption. Conversely, a lower compression quality may speed up processing but at the cost of larger output sizes. Therefore, variations in this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
