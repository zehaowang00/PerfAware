    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration in the dconverter software project directly influences how data is processed and managed within the system. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets or high-frequency data processing. For instance, switching between different scaling modes may alter the algorithm's complexity and resource allocation, resulting in increased memory consumption or slower execution times. Therefore, its impact on overall system performance is substantial, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
