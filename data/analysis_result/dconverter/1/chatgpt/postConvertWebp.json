    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the processing of image conversion tasks. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, particularly if the conversion process involves different algorithms or settings that optimize for speed or quality. Additionally, altering this configuration may affect memory consumption, as different conversion methods may require varying amounts of memory for buffering and processing images. Therefore, any adjustments to 'postConvertWebp' can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
