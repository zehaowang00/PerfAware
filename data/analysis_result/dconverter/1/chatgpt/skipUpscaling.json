    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration in the dconverter project directly influences the processing of input data. When enabled, it bypasses the upscaling step, which can significantly reduce the computational load and memory usage during data processing. This change can lead to notable variations in execution time, especially when handling large datasets. Therefore, altering this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
