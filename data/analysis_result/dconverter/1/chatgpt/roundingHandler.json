    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how numerical values are processed and represented. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time due to different algorithms being employed for rounding, which may require more or less computational resources. Additionally, improper rounding can lead to increased memory consumption if more precision is required to maintain accuracy in calculations. As a result, the choice of rounding method can significantly impact overall system performance, making it a critical configuration to monitor."
