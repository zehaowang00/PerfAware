    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the graphical user interface's rendering and responsiveness. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in resource allocation for rendering processes, which can significantly impact execution time and memory consumption. For instance, enabling advanced graphical features may increase CPU and GPU load, resulting in slower performance, especially on lower-end hardware. Conversely, disabling these options may improve performance by reducing resource usage, thus affecting the overall user experience and system efficiency."
