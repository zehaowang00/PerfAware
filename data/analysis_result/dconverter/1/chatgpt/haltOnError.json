    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project primarily controls the behavior of the system in response to errors during execution. While it may affect the flow of execution (e.g., stopping or continuing processing), it does not directly influence execution time or memory consumption in a significant manner. The performance impact is generally minimal since the configuration's primary role is to manage error handling rather than optimize resource usage or processing speed. Therefore, changes to this configuration are unlikely to result in notable variations in system performance."
