This is particularly useful for users who may want to review or use the original files later.\n  \n### Key Components:\n- **Processor Interfaces**: The configuration interacts with two main interfaces: `IPostProcessor` and `IPlatformConverter`. Depending on the type of processor being used, the configuration is passed to the respective method (`process` or `convert`) to dictate the handling of unoptimized files.\n  \n- **Preference Store**: The `loadPrefs` method retrieves user preferences from a `preferenceStore`, which holds the configuration settings. The `keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor` setting is applied to a checkbox (`cbKeepUnoptimized`), allowing users to modify this preference through the user interface.\n\n### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- **Conditional Logic**: The configuration is checked within the `run` method, where it influences the behavior of the file processing based on the type of processor being utilized. This conditional logic ensures that the appropriate processing method is called with the correct settings.\n  \n- **User Interface Integration**: The configuration is directly tied to the user interface, allowing users to set their preferences easily.

While it influences the processing logic, it does not directly cause significant performance variations through time-consuming or memory-heavy operations. Retaining unoptimized files is a decision that affects file management rather than the core processing workload itself, which is handled by the `IPostProcessor` or `IPlatformConverter`. Therefore, its impact on overall system performance is minor and does not classify it as performance-sensitive."
