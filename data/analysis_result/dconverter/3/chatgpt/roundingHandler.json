    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how numerical values are processed and represented. Changes in the rounding method can lead to variations in execution time, especially in computationally intensive tasks where rounding operations are frequent. Additionally, different rounding strategies may affect memory consumption due to the way data is stored and manipulated, potentially leading to increased resource usage or altered performance characteristics in numerical computations. Therefore, the choice of roundingHandler can significantly impact overall system performance."
