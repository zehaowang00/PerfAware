    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the graphical user interface's responsiveness and resource allocation. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, particularly in scenarios where advanced graphical features are enabled or disabled. For instance, enabling certain advanced options may increase memory consumption and processing time due to additional rendering tasks, while disabling them could lead to faster performance but at the cost of reduced functionality. Therefore, the impact of this configuration on system performance is significant, making it performance-sensitive."
