    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' directly influences how image assets are organized and processed in the iOS application. If this configuration is set to create separate folders for image sets, it can lead to improved performance in terms of loading times and memory management, as the system can access and cache images more efficiently. Conversely, if this option is disabled, the application may experience increased execution time and memory consumption due to less efficient asset management. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact the overall performance of the system."
