    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the processing of image conversion tasks. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in the algorithms used for converting images to WebP format, which can significantly affect execution time and memory usage. For instance, enabling or disabling certain features associated with 'postConvertWebp' may result in different levels of compression, impacting the speed of conversion and the amount of memory required to handle image data. Therefore, its value change can lead to notable variations in overall system performance."
