    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because enabling verbose logging typically results in a significant increase in the amount of data written to logs, which can lead to increased I/O operations and higher CPU usage for formatting and writing log messages. This can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially in high-throughput scenarios where logging overhead can become a bottleneck. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can directly impact the overall performance of the system."
