    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration in the dconverter software directly influences the efficiency of data compression algorithms. A higher compression quality typically results in better data reduction but requires more CPU cycles and memory usage, leading to increased execution time. Conversely, a lower compression quality may speed up processing but at the cost of larger output sizes. This trade-off means that changes in 'compressionQuality' can significantly impact overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
