    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because enabling anti-aliasing typically requires additional computational resources to smooth out edges in rendered images. This can lead to increased execution time and higher memory consumption, especially in graphics-intensive applications. The change in this configuration can significantly impact the overall performance of the system, particularly in scenarios where rendering speed and resource utilization are critical."
