    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project primarily controls the behavior of the application in response to errors. While it may influence the flow of execution (e.g., whether the application stops processing upon encountering an error), it does not directly impact resource utilization metrics such as execution time or memory consumption in a significant manner. The performance implications are minimal, as the overall resource usage remains largely unchanged regardless of whether the application halts on an error or continues processing. Therefore, this configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
