    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration in the dconverter software project directly influences how data is processed and rendered. When this option is enabled, the system skips the upscaling process, which can lead to significant reductions in execution time and memory usage, especially when handling large datasets or high-resolution inputs. This change can cause notable variations in overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
