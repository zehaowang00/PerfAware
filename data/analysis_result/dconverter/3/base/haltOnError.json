The justification provided highlights that this configuration primarily influences job control flow and error handling, which does not inherently lead to significant performance impacts. The operations involved, such as exception checking and UI updates, are not resource-intensive and do not cause substantial variations in performance. Thus, the conclusions drawn in the performance sensitivity analysis are accurate and well-supported."
