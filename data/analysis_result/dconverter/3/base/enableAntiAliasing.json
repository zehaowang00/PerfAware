This operation can be time-intensive, especially for large images or when processing multiple images, as it involves complex calculations to smooth edges and enhance visual quality. The performance impact is significant because applying anti-aliasing can lead to increased processing time and memory usage, particularly when handling high-resolution images or large batches of images, making it a critical factor in performance evaluation."
