Specifically, this configuration determines whether the application should skip the upscaling of images during processing.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **User Preference**: The `skipUpscaling` checkbox allows users to choose whether they want the application to perform upscaling on images. If selected, the application will bypass any upscaling operations, which may be desirable in scenarios where users only want to process images that are already at or above the desired resolution.\n  \n- **Integration with UI**: The configuration interacts with the user interface through the `cbSkipUpscaling` checkbox. The state of this checkbox is set based on the user's saved preferences retrieved from the `Arguments` object.
