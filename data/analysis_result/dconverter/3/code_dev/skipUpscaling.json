When enabled, the application will skip any upscaling operations, potentially preserving the original resolution of images that would otherwise be enlarged.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Arguments Class**: This class serves as the data structure that holds various user-defined settings, including `skipUpscaling`. It retrieves these settings from a `preferenceStore`.\n- **Checkbox Component (`cbSkipUpscaling`)**: This graphical user interface (GUI) element allows users to toggle the `skipUpscaling` option.
