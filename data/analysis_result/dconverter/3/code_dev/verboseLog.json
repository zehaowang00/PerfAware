Its primary purpose is to enhance the visibility of the execution process by controlling whether additional log information is printed to the console.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- When `verboseLog` is set to `true`, the system outputs the execution log and any encountered exceptions in a detailed manner. This includes printing the complete log of the process and the stack traces of exceptions, which aids in debugging and understanding the flow of execution.\n- If `verboseLog` is `false`, the system suppresses this detailed output, resulting in a cleaner console output that focuses on essential information only.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The configuration relies on the `args` object, which is presumably part of the method's context or passed to it. This object contains the `verboseLog` boolean flag that dictates the logging behavior.\n- The method also interacts with a list of `Exception` objects, which are generated during the execution of jobs. The presence of exceptions and their handling is contingent upon the `verboseLog` setting.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\n- The `onFinished` method is likely part of a larger job processing framework where multiple jobs are executed. The `finishedJobs` and `exceptions` parameters indicate the outcome of these jobs.\n- The logging behavior influenced by `verboseLog` can affect how developers and operators monitor and troubleshoot the system, thereby impacting their ability to respond to issues effectively.\n\nIn summary, the `verboseLog` configuration plays a crucial role in determining the level of detail provided in logs, facilitating better understanding and debugging of the system's execution flow without altering the core functionality of the job processing mechanism."
