This configuration is part of the `Arguments` object retrieved from the `preferenceStore`, which holds various user preferences and settings.\n\n### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `guiAdvancedOptions` configuration is to toggle between two user interface states: advanced and simple. When `guiAdvancedOptions` is set to `true`, the application will present advanced options to the user, allowing for more detailed configuration. Conversely, when it is set to `false`, the application will display a simplified interface, likely hiding more complex settings to streamline the user experience.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **Arguments**: This object encapsulates various user preferences, including `guiAdvancedOptions`. It serves as the source of truth for the application's configuration.\n- **preferenceStore**: This is the mechanism through which the application retrieves user preferences. It is essential for loading the configuration settings into the application.\n- **Radio Buttons (rbOptAdvanced and rbOptSimple)**: These UI components represent the two states of the configuration. They are updated based on the value of `guiAdvancedOptions` to reflect the current user preference.\n\n### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `loadPrefs()` method is responsible for initializing the UI components based on the stored preferences. When this method is called, it checks if the `Arguments` object is not null and then sets the state of the radio buttons according to the value of `guiAdvancedOptions`. This interaction ensures that the user interface aligns with the user's previous choices, enhancing usability and providing a personalized experience.\n\nOverall, the `guiAdvancedOptions` configuration is integral to the user experience, allowing users to choose their preferred level of detail in the application's interface."
