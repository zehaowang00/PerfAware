    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration in the dconverter software project is not performance-sensitive because it primarily affects the control flow of the application rather than its resource consumption or execution efficiency. Changing this configuration may alter the behavior of the software in terms of error handling, but it does not lead to significant variations in execution time or memory usage. Therefore, its impact on overall system performance is minimal."
