    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project directly influences how data is processed and transformed. Changes in this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, particularly when handling large datasets or complex transformations. For instance, switching from a 'linear' to a 'non-linear' scaling mode may require additional computational resources, resulting in increased memory consumption and longer processing times. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as its value change can notably affect overall system performance."
