    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the processing of image conversion tasks. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time due to the differing levels of optimization applied during the conversion process. For instance, enabling or disabling this option may alter the algorithms used for image processing, which can either enhance or degrade performance based on the complexity of the images being converted. Additionally, variations in memory consumption can occur, as different processing methods may require more or less memory depending on the configuration settings, impacting overall system performance and resource utilization."
