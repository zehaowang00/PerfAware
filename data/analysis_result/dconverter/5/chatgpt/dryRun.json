    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration in the dconverter project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the execution flow of the software. When enabled, the system performs a simulation of the operations without executing them, which can significantly reduce resource consumption and execution time. Conversely, if disabled, the system will execute all operations, potentially leading to increased memory usage and longer execution times. This variation in behavior based on the configuration value can lead to notable differences in overall system performance, making it a critical parameter to consider in performance tuning."
