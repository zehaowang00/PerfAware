Its primary purpose is to determine whether the directories containing files to be converted should be cleared before the conversion process begins.\\n\\n1. **Functionality**:\\n   - When the `clearDirBeforeConvert` option is enabled (set to `true`), the application will log a message indicating that it will clear out directories prior to the conversion. This is particularly important for ensuring that no residual files from previous operations interfere with the current conversion task.\\n   - The actual clearing of directories is performed by invoking the `clean` method on each `IPlatformConverter` instance, which is responsible for managing the conversion process for different platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows, Web).\\n\\n2. **Dependencies**:\\n   - This configuration relies on the `Arguments` object, which holds user-defined settings, including the `clearDirBeforeConvert` flag.\\n   - The `execute` method checks this flag and interacts with a collection of `IPlatformConverter` instances to perform the cleaning operation.\\n\\n3. **Key Components Involved**:\\n   - **`Arguments`**: Contains the configuration settings retrieved from the user interface, including the `clearDirBeforeConvert` option.\\n   - **`IPlatformConverter`**: An interface that represents different platform-specific converters. Each converter implements the `clean` method to handle the directory clearing process.\\n   - **Logging Mechanism**: The application logs actions taken during the execution, providing visibility into whether directories are cleared.\\n\\n4. **Interaction with Other Parts of the System**:\\n   - The `loadPrefs` method is responsible for loading user preferences, including the `clearDirBeforeConvert` setting, from a `preferenceStore`.
