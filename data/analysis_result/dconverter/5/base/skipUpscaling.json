When enabled, it may prevent certain processing steps that would typically upscale images, thus affecting how images are handled based on user preferences.\\n\\n4. **User Interface Representation**:\\n   - The checkbox is part of the UI, providing a clear and direct way for users to control whether upscaling occurs, making it an important aspect of the application's configurability.\\n\\nIn summary, the `skipUpscaling` configuration plays a crucial role in defining user preferences for image processing, directly impacting how the application behaves based on user input. It interacts with various components of the system, ensuring that user-defined settings are respected during image processing tasks.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
