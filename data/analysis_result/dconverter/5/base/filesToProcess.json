This configuration plays a vital role in the overall functionality of the application by enabling the user to specify which files should be converted based on the selected platforms.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n\n1. **Integration with Arguments**:\n   - The `filesToProcess` parameter is part of the `Arguments` class, which encapsulates various settings and options for the conversion process. It directly influences how the `clean` and `execute` methods operate.\n\n2. **Interaction with the Clean Method**:\n   - In the `clean` method, `filesToProcess` is utilized to determine the specific folders that need to be deleted. If the `iosCreateImagesetFolders` flag is set to true and there is only one platform, the method iterates through each file in `filesToProcess` to delete associated image set folders. This ensures that the workspace is prepared correctly before starting the conversion process.\n\n3. **Execution in the Execute Method**:\n   - The `execute` method checks if `filesToProcess` is empty before proceeding with the conversion. If files are present, it validates their existence, ensuring that all specified files are valid and ready for processing. This validation step is crucial to prevent errors during the conversion workflow.\n   - The method also initiates worker handlers that will process each file listed in `filesToProcess`, coordinating the conversion and any subsequent post-processing steps.\n\n4. **Dependency on Other Configuration Parameters**:\n   - The effectiveness of `filesToProcess` is dependent on other parameters within the `Arguments` class, such as `platform`, `clearDirBeforeConvert`, and various post-processing tool flags. These dependencies dictate how the files are handled and processed based on user selections.\n\nIn summary, `filesToProcess` is a fundamental configuration element that directly influences the behavior of the conversion process, ensuring that the correct files are targeted for processing while interacting seamlessly with other components of the system."

This configuration plays a vital role in the overall functionality of the application by enabling the user to specify which files should be converted based on the selected platforms.\\n\\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\\n\\n1. **Integration with Arguments**:\\n   - The `filesToProcess` parameter is part of the `Arguments` class, which encapsulates various settings and options for the conversion process. It directly influences how the `clean` and `execute` methods operate.\\n\\n2. **Interaction with the Clean Method**:\\n   - In the `clean` method, `filesToProcess` is utilized to determine the specific folders that need to be deleted. If the `iosCreateImagesetFolders` flag is set to true and there is only one platform, the method iterates through each file in `filesToProcess` to delete associated image set folders. This ensures that the workspace is prepared correctly before starting the conversion process.\\n\\n3. **Execution in the Execute Method**:\\n   - The `execute` method checks if `filesToProcess` is empty before proceeding with the conversion. If files are present, it validates their existence, ensuring that all specified files are valid and ready for processing. This validation step is crucial to prevent errors during the conversion workflow.\\n   - The method also initiates worker handlers that will process each file listed in `filesToProcess`, coordinating the conversion and any subsequent post-processing steps.\\n\\n4. **Dependency on Other Configuration Parameters**:\\n   - The effectiveness of `filesToProcess` is dependent on other parameters within the `Arguments` class, such as `platform`, `clearDirBeforeConvert`, and various post-processing tool flags. These dependencies dictate how the files are handled and processed based on user selections.\\n\\nIn summary, `filesToProcess` is a fundamental configuration element that directly influences the behavior of the conversion process, ensuring that the correct files are targeted for processing while interacting seamlessly with other components of the system.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up review.
