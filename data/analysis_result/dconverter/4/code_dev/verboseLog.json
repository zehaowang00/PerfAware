It provides developers with insights into the execution context, making it easier to diagnose issues and understand the flow of the application.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Execution Logging**: The configuration controls the printing of logs to the console. If `verboseLog` is set to true, the system outputs the complete log of the execution process, which includes details about finished jobs and any errors that occurred.\n- **Error Reporting**: In the event of exceptions, `verboseLog` facilitates the printing of error messages and stack traces, providing developers with critical information needed for debugging.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `verboseLog` configuration interacts with the `args` object, which presumably holds various runtime parameters. Its state directly influences the behavior of the logging statements within the `onFinished` method.\n- The method checks the state of `verboseLog` before executing logging statements, ensuring that detailed logs are only printed when explicitly requested. This selective logging helps in maintaining clarity in the output while allowing for deeper insights when necessary.\n\nIn summary, the `verboseLog` configuration plays a crucial role in controlling the verbosity of logs generated during the execution of jobs, aiding developers in monitoring and troubleshooting the system effectively."
