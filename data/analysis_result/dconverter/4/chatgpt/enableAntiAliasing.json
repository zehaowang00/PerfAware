    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because enabling anti-aliasing typically requires additional computational resources to smooth out edges in rendered images. This process can significantly increase the execution time and memory consumption, especially in graphics-intensive applications. A change in this configuration can lead to noticeable variations in performance metrics, such as frame rates or rendering times, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
