    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration in the dconverter software project primarily controls the behavior of the application in response to errors. While it can affect the flow of execution (i.e., whether the application stops processing upon encountering an error), it does not directly influence performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption in a significant manner. The overall performance impact is minimal, as the primary concern of this configuration is error handling rather than resource management or processing efficiency."
