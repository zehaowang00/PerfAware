    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this option directly impacts the encoding efficiency and quality of JPEG images. When enabled, it utilizes the MozJPEG library, which can significantly reduce file sizes and improve encoding speed compared to standard JPEG encoding. This change can lead to notable variations in execution time during image processing tasks and can also affect memory consumption due to different algorithmic approaches used in compression. Therefore, the performance characteristics of the system can vary significantly based on the state of this configuration."
