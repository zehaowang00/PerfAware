    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the graphical user interface's rendering and interaction capabilities. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially if advanced graphical features are enabled or disabled. For instance, enabling complex rendering options may increase memory consumption and processing time, leading to a slower user experience. Conversely, disabling such options can enhance performance by reducing resource usage. Therefore, the value change of this configuration can notably affect overall system performance."
