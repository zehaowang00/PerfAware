    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'outputCompressionMode' configuration in the dconverter software project directly influences the way data is processed and stored. Changing this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time due to the overhead associated with different compression algorithms, as well as memory consumption, which may increase or decrease depending on the selected mode. For instance, a more aggressive compression mode may reduce output size but require more CPU cycles, thereby impacting overall system performance. Conversely, a less aggressive mode might speed up processing but result in larger output sizes. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
