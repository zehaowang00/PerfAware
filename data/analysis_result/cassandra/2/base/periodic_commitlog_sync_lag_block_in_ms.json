This value is converted from milliseconds to nanoseconds.\n\n2. **Commit Log Sync Period**:\n   - The constructor of `PeriodicCommitLogService` calls the superclass constructor with a sync period obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor.getCommitLogSyncPeriod()`. This indicates how often the commit log should be synchronized.\n\n3. **Compression and Encryption Configuration**:\n   - The constructor checks the `commitLog.configuration` to determine if compression or encryption is used. If either is enabled, the service will adjust its behavior accordingly by passing a boolean value to the superclass constructor.\n\n### Method Behavior:\n- The `maybeWaitForSync` method uses the `blockWhenSyncLagsNanos` to determine if the service should wait for synchronization based on the last sync time compared to the expected sync time. If the last sync is older than the expected time, it increments a pending count and awaits synchronization.\n\nThis configuration context is crucial for understanding the performance and behavior of the `PeriodicCommitLogService` in relation to commit log synchronization."
