If it does, an error is logged, and the connection is closed.\n   - Additionally, it checks for a per-IP limit on connections. If the limit is exceeded for a specific IP address, it logs an error and closes the connection.\n\n3. **Pipeline Configuration**:\n   - The `configureInitialPipeline` method configures the channel pipeline to include a `ConnectionLimitHandler` if either the maximum concurrent connections or the per-IP connection limit is greater than zero.\n   - This ensures that the connection limits are enforced as the first action in the pipeline.\n\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\n- **native_transport_max_concurrent_connections**: Maximum number of concurrent native connections.\n- **native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip**: Maximum number of concurrent native connections allowed per IP address.\n- **native_transport_idle_timeout**: Timeout for idle connections (not directly shown in the summarized code but referenced in the pipeline configuration).\n\nThis configuration is crucial for managing connection limits and ensuring that the system can handle traffic efficiently without overwhelming resources."
