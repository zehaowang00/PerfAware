But then the operation proposing the empty update will not succeed\n                //     either (it will retry or ultimately timeout), and we're actually ok if earlier pending operation gets\n                //     replayed in that case.\n                // Tl;dr, it is safe to skip committing empty updates _as long as_ we also skip replying them below.

If the configured timeout is exceeded, a `CasWriteTimeoutException` is triggered, indicating that the operation could not be completed within the allowed timeframe.\n- The configuration is flexible, allowing for adjustments based on the needs of the system, which can be particularly useful in varying operational contexts.\n\nThis summary provides a clear understanding of the CAS contention timeout's role within the system, its dependencies, and its interactions with other components without delving into performance considerations."
