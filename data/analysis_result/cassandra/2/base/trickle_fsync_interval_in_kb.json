If it does, it triggers a file synchronization (`fsync()`), ensuring that data is written to disk periodically based on the defined interval.\n\n2. **Cache Skipping Logic**:\n   - The method `maybeSkipCache()` determines whether to skip the page cache for files based on their size. It uses the same configuration parameter (`DatabaseDescriptor.getTrickleFsyncIntervalInKb()`) to decide if the current position warrants skipping the cache. If the position is large enough, it attempts to skip the cache using `NativeLibrary.trySkipCache()`.\n\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\n- **Trickle Fsync Interval**: Configured through `DatabaseDescriptor.getTrickleFsyncIntervalInKb()`, which defines the threshold for both fsync operations and cache skipping logic.\n\nThis information will assist the Performance Agent in analyzing the caching and synchronization behavior of the system."
