The policies, especially `stop_paranoid`, `stop`, and `die`, can lead to immediate halting of transports or JVM termination, which are time-intensive operations that can significantly affect performance. Additionally, the handling of disk errors and marking directories as unwritable or unreadable involves memory and processing overhead, especially under high load or failure conditions, making this configuration sensitive to performance variations."
