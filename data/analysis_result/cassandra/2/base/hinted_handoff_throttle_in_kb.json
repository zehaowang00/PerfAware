If this value is set to 0, the rate limiter is effectively disabled (set to `Double.MAX_VALUE`).\\n   - The maximum rate is scaled based on the number of nodes in the cluster, ensuring that the traffic is bounded per node rather than overall outgoing traffic from the dispatching node.\\n\\n2. **Node Count Calculation**:\\n   - The number of nodes is determined by retrieving the total number of endpoints from the `TokenMetadata` of the `StorageService`, subtracting one to exclude the current node.\\n\\n3. **Rate Limiter Initialization**:\\n   - The rate limiter is initialized with a calculated throttle value, which is derived from the configured throttle in kilobytes, converted to bytes, and divided by the number of nodes.
