    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration in Cassandra determines the implementation of the row cache, which can significantly impact how data is stored and retrieved in memory. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in cache hit rates, affecting overall execution time and memory consumption. A more efficient cache implementation can reduce latency and improve throughput, while a less efficient one can lead to increased memory usage and slower response times. Therefore, modifications to this setting are likely to have a notable effect on system performance."
