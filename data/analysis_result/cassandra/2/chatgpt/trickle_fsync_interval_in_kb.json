    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync_interval_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the system flushes data to disk in kilobytes. A lower value can lead to more frequent disk writes, which can significantly impact execution time and overall throughput, especially under heavy write loads. Conversely, a higher value may reduce the frequency of these writes, potentially increasing memory consumption and delaying data persistence. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
