    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of cached rows that can fail before an operation is considered unsuccessful. A change in this threshold can significantly impact performance, as a lower threshold may lead to increased cache misses and more frequent read operations from disk, resulting in higher execution times and increased memory consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may improve performance by allowing more cached rows to be utilized effectively, reducing the need for disk access. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
