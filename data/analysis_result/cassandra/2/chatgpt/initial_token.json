    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining the distribution of data across nodes in a cluster. A change in its value can lead to significant variations in data partitioning, which directly impacts load balancing, read/write performance, and overall system throughput. If the initial token is not set correctly, it can cause hotspots in data access patterns, leading to increased latency and uneven resource utilization among nodes. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as its adjustment can notably affect system performance metrics."
