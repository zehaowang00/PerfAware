    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the granularity of timer events and scheduling within the Windows operating system. A lower timer interval can lead to more frequent context switches and increased CPU overhead, which may degrade overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timer interval can reduce CPU usage but may lead to latency in processing tasks. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
