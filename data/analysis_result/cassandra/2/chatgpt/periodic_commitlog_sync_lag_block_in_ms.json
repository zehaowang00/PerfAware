    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' in Cassandra directly influences the frequency and timing of commit log synchronization. A lower value can lead to more frequent disk writes, reducing the risk of data loss but potentially increasing I/O contention and affecting overall throughput. Conversely, a higher value may improve write performance by batching writes but increases the risk of data loss in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
