    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in Cassandra is critical for managing user roles and permissions, which directly impacts how data is accessed and secured. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in scenarios with high concurrency or complex access patterns. If the role management is inefficiently configured, it can result in increased latency for read and write operations, as well as higher memory consumption due to excessive role checks or caching mechanisms. Therefore, its value change can notably affect overall system performance."
