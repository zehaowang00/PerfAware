    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of tokens that a node is responsible for in a distributed environment. A change in this value can significantly impact data distribution, load balancing, and the overall performance of the cluster. If 'num_tokens' is set too low, it can lead to uneven data distribution, causing some nodes to become overloaded while others are underutilized, resulting in increased execution time and memory consumption. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive overhead in managing tokens and complicate data rebalancing. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance."
