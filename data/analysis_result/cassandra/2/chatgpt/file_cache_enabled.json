    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration in Cassandra significantly affects system performance because it determines whether the file system cache is utilized for read and write operations. Enabling file caching can lead to reduced disk I/O and faster access times for frequently accessed data, resulting in lower execution times and improved overall throughput. Conversely, disabling this option may lead to increased latency and higher memory consumption as the system may need to read data directly from disk more frequently. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on the performance characteristics of the Cassandra database."
