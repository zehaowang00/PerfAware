    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of simultaneous SSTable upgrades that can occur. Increasing this value allows more upgrades to happen concurrently, which can lead to higher resource utilization (CPU, I/O, and memory) and potentially reduce the overall time taken for upgrades. Conversely, setting this value too low may cause bottlenecks, leading to longer upgrade times and increased latency for read and write operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
