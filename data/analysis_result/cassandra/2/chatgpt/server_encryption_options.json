    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the overhead associated with data encryption and decryption processes. Changes in encryption algorithms or key lengths can lead to significant variations in CPU usage and latency during data access operations. If encryption is enabled or configured with a more complex algorithm, it can increase the execution time for read and write operations, thus affecting overall system throughput and response times. Additionally, the memory consumption may also vary based on the encryption settings, as different algorithms may require different amounts of memory for processing. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
