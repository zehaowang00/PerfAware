    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the maximum size of data that can be stored in a single value. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and garbage collection behavior. If the value is set too high, it may lead to increased memory usage, potentially causing out-of-memory errors or excessive garbage collection pauses, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too low can lead to increased write amplification and more frequent data fragmentation, negatively impacting read and write performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on the performance characteristics of the system."
