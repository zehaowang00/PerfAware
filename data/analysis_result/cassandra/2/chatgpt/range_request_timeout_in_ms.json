    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the time allowed for range requests to complete. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent request timeouts, causing increased retries and negatively affecting overall throughput and latency. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to resource contention and longer wait times for other operations, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and system performance."
