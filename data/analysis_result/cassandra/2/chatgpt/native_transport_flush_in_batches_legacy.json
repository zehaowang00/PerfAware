    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' in Cassandra controls how data is flushed to the native transport layer in batches. Changing this setting can significantly impact the performance of data writes and reads. If the flush size is too small, it can lead to increased I/O operations, which may degrade performance due to higher latency and resource contention. Conversely, if the flush size is too large, it can consume excessive memory and lead to longer garbage collection pauses, affecting overall system throughput. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
