    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how frequently the system updates its knowledge of node performance in a cluster. A shorter update interval allows the system to react more quickly to changes in node performance, potentially improving read latency and overall throughput. Conversely, a longer interval may lead to outdated performance metrics, causing the system to make suboptimal routing decisions for requests. This can result in increased execution time and higher memory consumption due to inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
