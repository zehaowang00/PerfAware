    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the trade-off between consistency and performance. Changing this setting can significantly impact read and write latencies, as well as the overall throughput of the system. A higher consistency level typically requires more nodes to acknowledge a read or write operation, which can lead to increased execution time and resource consumption, especially under heavy load or in distributed environments. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in system performance."
