    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' in Cassandra determines the total amount of disk space allocated for commit logs. If this value is set too low, it can lead to frequent log rollovers, increased disk I/O, and potential data loss if the logs cannot be flushed in time. Conversely, setting it too high can waste disk space and affect overall storage efficiency. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly impact system performance by affecting write latency, disk usage, and the ability to recover from failures."
