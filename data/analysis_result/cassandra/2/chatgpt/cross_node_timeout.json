    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timeouts for inter-node communication. If this value is set too low, it can lead to increased failure rates in distributed operations, causing retries and potentially impacting overall system throughput and latency. Conversely, if set too high, it may delay the detection of actual node failures, leading to inefficient resource utilization and prolonged periods of degraded performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and system responsiveness."
