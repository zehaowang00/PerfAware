    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in Cassandra directly impacts the caching mechanism for counter data. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage as more keys are cached, potentially improving read performance by reducing disk I/O. Conversely, a lower value may lead to more frequent cache misses, resulting in increased execution time for read operations and higher latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
