    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the commit log is flushed to disk. A change in this setting can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of write latency and data durability. If set to synchronous, it ensures data is immediately written to disk, which can lead to lower write throughput but higher data safety. Conversely, if set to asynchronous, it may improve write performance but at the risk of potential data loss during a crash. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
