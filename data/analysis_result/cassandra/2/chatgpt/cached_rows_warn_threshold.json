    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system manages cached rows during query execution. A lower threshold may lead to more frequent warnings about cache usage, prompting the system to evict cached data more often, which can increase disk I/O and degrade performance. Conversely, a higher threshold may allow more data to remain in the cache, improving read performance but potentially leading to increased memory consumption. Changes to this configuration can thus significantly impact execution time and memory usage, making it a critical parameter for performance tuning."
