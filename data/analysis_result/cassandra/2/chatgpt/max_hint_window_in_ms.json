    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'max_hint_window_in_ms' in Cassandra determines the maximum time window for storing hints for failed nodes. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving node failures and recovery. If the window is set too low, hints may be discarded before they can be applied, leading to increased data inconsistency and potential performance degradation during read and write operations. Conversely, a very high value may lead to excessive memory consumption as more hints are retained, which can also affect performance negatively. Therefore, the sensitivity of this configuration directly correlates with its influence on both execution time and resource utilization."
