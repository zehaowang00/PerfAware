    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timeout settings for TCP connections between nodes during data streaming. A lower timeout value can lead to premature disconnections, resulting in increased retries and potentially higher latency in data transfer. Conversely, a higher timeout may allow for longer waits, which can lead to resource contention and increased memory usage if connections are held open unnecessarily. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource consumption, making it critical for performance tuning."
