    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. Changes to the partitioner can significantly impact data locality, load balancing, and the efficiency of read and write operations. A poor partitioning strategy can lead to hotspots, where some nodes handle more requests than others, resulting in increased latency and resource consumption. Additionally, it can affect the overall performance of queries and the system's ability to scale efficiently. Therefore, variations in the partitioner's configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
