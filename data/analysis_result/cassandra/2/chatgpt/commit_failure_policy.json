    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to failures during commit operations. Changes to this policy can significantly impact system performance, as they dictate whether to retry, ignore, or abort transactions upon failure. For instance, a policy that opts for retries may lead to increased execution times and resource consumption under high load, while a policy that ignores failures may result in data inconsistency or loss, affecting overall system reliability and performance. Thus, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
