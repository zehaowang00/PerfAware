    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of data that can be cached in memory for quick access. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially for read-heavy workloads. If the cache size is too small, it may result in increased disk I/O as data is fetched from storage instead of memory, leading to higher latency and reduced throughput. Conversely, a larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need for disk access, but it also increases memory consumption, which can affect the overall system performance if memory resources are constrained. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
