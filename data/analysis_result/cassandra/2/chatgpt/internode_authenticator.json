    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the authentication mechanism between nodes in a cluster. If the authentication method is changed to a more complex or resource-intensive algorithm, it can lead to increased latency in inter-node communication and higher CPU usage. This can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, especially in high-throughput environments where rapid node communication is critical for maintaining performance. Additionally, variations in authentication can lead to fluctuations in execution time for requests that require inter-node coordination, thereby impacting the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the database system."
