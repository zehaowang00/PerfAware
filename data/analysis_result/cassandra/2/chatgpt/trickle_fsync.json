    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync' configuration in Cassandra controls the frequency of flushing data to disk, which directly impacts the durability and performance of write operations. A lower value can lead to more frequent disk writes, reducing the risk of data loss but potentially increasing I/O contention and latency. Conversely, a higher value may improve throughput but increase the risk of data loss during crashes. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
