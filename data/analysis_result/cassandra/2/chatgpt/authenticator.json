    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how authentication requests are processed. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, especially under high load conditions. For instance, switching from a simple authentication mechanism to a more complex one (like LDAP or Kerberos) can significantly increase the time taken for each authentication request, affecting overall system throughput and latency. Additionally, the choice of authenticator can impact memory usage, as different mechanisms may require varying amounts of resources to maintain session states or user credentials. Therefore, any modification to the 'authenticator' setting can have a notable effect on the performance of the Cassandra system."
