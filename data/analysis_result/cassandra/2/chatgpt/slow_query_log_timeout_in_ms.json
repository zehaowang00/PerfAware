    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging slow queries. If this value is set too high, it may lead to an increased number of queries being logged, which can consume additional I/O and storage resources, potentially impacting overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too low may result in important queries being missed, affecting performance tuning and monitoring. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect the execution time of queries and the resource consumption of the system, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
