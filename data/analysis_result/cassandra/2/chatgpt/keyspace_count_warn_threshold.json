    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's ability to manage and monitor keyspaces effectively. If this threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive warnings and alerts, causing unnecessary overhead in monitoring processes and potentially affecting system performance. Conversely, if set too high, it may result in insufficient monitoring of keyspaces, leading to performance degradation due to untracked resource consumption. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and resource utilization, making it a critical parameter for performance tuning."
