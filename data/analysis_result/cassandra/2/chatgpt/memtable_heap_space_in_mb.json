    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. A change in this configuration can significantly impact the system's performance, particularly in terms of write throughput and latency. If the allocated heap space is too low, it can lead to increased flushing to disk, resulting in higher I/O operations and slower read performance. Conversely, if the heap space is set too high, it may lead to excessive garbage collection pauses, affecting overall system responsiveness. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
