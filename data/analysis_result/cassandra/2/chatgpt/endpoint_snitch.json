    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'endpoint_snitch' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in data locality, which affects read and write latencies. If the snitch is not configured optimally, it can result in uneven data distribution, causing some nodes to become hotspots while others remain underutilized. This imbalance can lead to increased response times and higher resource consumption, ultimately impacting the overall performance of the Cassandra system."
