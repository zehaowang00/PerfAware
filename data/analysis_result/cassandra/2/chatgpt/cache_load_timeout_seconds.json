    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the time allowed for loading data into the cache. A lower timeout may lead to increased cache misses and higher latency in data retrieval, significantly impacting execution time and overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timeout could lead to prolonged waiting periods for cache loads, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, changes in this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
