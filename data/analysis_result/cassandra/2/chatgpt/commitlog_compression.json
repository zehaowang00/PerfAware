    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the I/O operations and disk space usage. Enabling or disabling compression can lead to significant variations in execution time due to changes in how data is written to disk. When compression is enabled, it reduces the amount of data written, which can improve write performance and decrease disk I/O. Conversely, if compression is disabled, more data is written, leading to increased I/O and potentially longer execution times. Additionally, the choice of compression algorithm can also impact CPU usage, further affecting overall system performance."
