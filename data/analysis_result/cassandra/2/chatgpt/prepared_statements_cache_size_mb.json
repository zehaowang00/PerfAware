    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'prepared_statements_cache_size_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the efficiency of query execution by controlling how many prepared statements can be cached in memory. A larger cache size can lead to reduced execution times for repeated queries, as the system can retrieve precompiled statements faster, thus minimizing the overhead of parsing and planning. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased execution times and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses and recompilation of statements. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
