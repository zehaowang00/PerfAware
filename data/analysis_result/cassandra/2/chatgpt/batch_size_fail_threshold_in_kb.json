    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts how the system handles batch operations. A change in this value can significantly affect the execution time and resource utilization during data writes. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to frequent failures of batch operations, causing increased retries and potentially higher latency. Conversely, a high threshold may allow larger batches to be processed, which can improve throughput but may also lead to increased memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
