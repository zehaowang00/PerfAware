    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles batch operations. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive warnings and potential throttling of batch writes, which can significantly increase execution time and reduce throughput. Conversely, setting it too high may result in large batch sizes that can overwhelm the system's memory and lead to increased garbage collection, affecting overall performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and memory consumption."
