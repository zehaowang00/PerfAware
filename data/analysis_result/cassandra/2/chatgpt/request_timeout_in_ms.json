    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how long the system waits for a response from a request before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to increased failure rates for requests that may require more time to process, especially under heavy load or when the system is experiencing latency. This can result in higher execution times as requests are retried or dropped, leading to variations in overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timeout value may allow for longer processing times, which can improve success rates but may also lead to resource contention and increased memory usage if many requests are held open for extended periods. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
