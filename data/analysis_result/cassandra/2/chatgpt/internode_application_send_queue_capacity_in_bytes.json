    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the capacity of the send queue for inter-node communication. A change in this value can lead to variations in how much data can be buffered before being sent to other nodes in the cluster. If the queue capacity is too low, it may cause increased latency and reduced throughput as nodes wait for the queue to clear before sending more data. Conversely, a very high capacity can lead to increased memory consumption and potential delays in processing messages, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
