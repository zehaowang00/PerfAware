    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' in Cassandra directly impacts how the system handles hints during write operations. If this value is set too low, it can lead to frequent flushing of hint files, which may increase disk I/O and CPU usage, thereby affecting overall performance. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors, especially under heavy write loads. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
