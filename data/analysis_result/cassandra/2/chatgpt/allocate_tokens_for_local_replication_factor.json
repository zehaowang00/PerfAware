    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in Cassandra directly influences how tokens are allocated for data distribution across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this configuration can significantly affect data locality and load balancing, which in turn impacts read and write performance. If the allocation is not optimized, it can lead to uneven data distribution, increased latency, and higher memory consumption due to inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and overall system performance."
