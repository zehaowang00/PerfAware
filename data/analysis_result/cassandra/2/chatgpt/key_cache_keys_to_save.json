    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_keys_to_save' in Cassandra directly influences the amount of data stored in the key cache. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage, which may improve read performance by reducing disk access for frequently accessed keys. Conversely, a lower value can lead to cache misses, resulting in more disk I/O and increased execution time for read operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
