    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the way the system handles client connections and data transport. Enabling or disabling native transport can lead to significant variations in execution time and resource utilization. When native transport is enabled, it allows for more efficient communication between clients and the Cassandra nodes, which can reduce latency and improve throughput. Conversely, if it is disabled, the system may fall back to less efficient communication methods, leading to increased execution times and higher memory consumption due to the overhead of handling connections differently. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
