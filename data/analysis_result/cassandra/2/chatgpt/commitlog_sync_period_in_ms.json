    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. A shorter sync period can lead to increased I/O operations, which may enhance data durability but can also significantly impact system performance by increasing latency and reducing throughput due to the higher frequency of disk writes. Conversely, a longer sync period may improve performance by reducing the number of writes but increases the risk of data loss in case of a crash. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
