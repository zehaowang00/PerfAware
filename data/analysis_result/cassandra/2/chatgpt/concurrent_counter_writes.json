    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how many concurrent writes can be processed for counter columns. A higher value allows more simultaneous writes, which can significantly improve throughput and reduce latency under heavy load. Conversely, a lower value may lead to increased contention and slower performance as writes are serialized. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
