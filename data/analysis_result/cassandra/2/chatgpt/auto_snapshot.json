    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the frequency and timing of data snapshots taken during write operations. If the snapshot frequency is too high, it can lead to increased disk I/O and CPU usage, which may significantly degrade overall system performance, especially under heavy load. Conversely, if snapshots are taken too infrequently, it can impact data recovery and consistency, leading to longer recovery times in case of failures. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and resource consumption."
