    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value can lead to quicker failure detection and recovery, which can enhance overall system responsiveness and throughput. Conversely, a higher timeout may result in prolonged delays in detecting failed nodes, potentially causing increased latency and reduced performance during high-load scenarios. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and system stability, making it critical for performance tuning."
