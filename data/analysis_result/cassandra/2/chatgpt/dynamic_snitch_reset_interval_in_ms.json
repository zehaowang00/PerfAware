    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the behavior of the dynamic snitching mechanism, which is responsible for optimizing read and write operations by routing requests to the most responsive nodes. A change in this interval can significantly impact how quickly the system adapts to varying node performance, affecting overall latency and throughput. If the interval is set too high, the system may not respond quickly enough to node failures or performance degradations, leading to increased execution times and potential bottlenecks. Conversely, a very low interval may cause excessive re-evaluation of node performance, leading to unnecessary overhead and increased memory consumption. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
