    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_optimization_strategy' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to and read from disk, which can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption. Different strategies can lead to variations in I/O operations, affecting latency and throughput. For instance, using a more aggressive disk optimization strategy may reduce disk I/O but could increase CPU usage, while a less aggressive strategy might lead to higher disk I/O and slower performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
