    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the behavior of the dynamic snitching mechanism, which is responsible for routing requests to the most responsive replicas. A change in this threshold can significantly alter the decision-making process of the snitch, leading to variations in request latencies and overall system throughput. If the threshold is set too high, it may cause the system to ignore poorly performing nodes, resulting in increased latencies and degraded performance. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to unnecessary rerouting of requests, causing additional overhead and resource consumption. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
