    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact system performance because it controls the logging of audit events. If enabled or set to a verbose level, it can lead to increased I/O operations and higher memory usage due to the additional data being processed and stored. This can result in notable variations in execution time, especially under high load, as the system may spend more resources on logging rather than processing queries. Therefore, changes to this configuration can directly affect the overall performance of the Cassandra database."
