    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently hints are flushed to disk. A shorter flush period can lead to more frequent disk I/O operations, which can significantly impact overall system performance, especially under heavy write loads or when the system is recovering from failures. Conversely, a longer flush period may lead to increased memory usage and delayed recovery times, potentially causing performance bottlenecks. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
