    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it determines how the system responds to disk failures. Depending on the policy set (e.g., 'stop', 'ignore', or 'best_effort'), the system's behavior during a disk failure can significantly impact performance. For instance, a more aggressive policy may lead to immediate halting of operations, causing increased latency and downtime, while a more lenient policy might allow continued operations at the cost of data integrity. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time, resource utilization, and overall system reliability, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
