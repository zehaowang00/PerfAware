    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'authorizer' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it determines the access control mechanism for database operations. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact the execution time of queries, especially in environments with high concurrency or complex permission structures. If the authorizer is set to a more complex or resource-intensive implementation, it can lead to increased latency and CPU usage due to additional checks for permissions on each operation. Conversely, a simpler authorizer may reduce overhead, resulting in faster query execution. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in overall system performance."
