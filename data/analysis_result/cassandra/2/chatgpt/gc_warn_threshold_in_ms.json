    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the garbage collection (GC) behavior of the system. If this threshold is set too low, it may lead to frequent GC warnings, indicating that the application is spending excessive time in garbage collection, which can significantly degrade performance by increasing execution time and potentially causing application pauses. Conversely, if set too high, it may mask underlying memory issues, leading to increased memory consumption and eventual out-of-memory errors. Thus, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
