    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the time allowed for write operations to complete before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to increased failure rates for write operations under high load, resulting in retries and potential data inconsistency, while a higher value may lead to increased resource consumption and latency in the system. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
