    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cdc_enabled' configuration in Cassandra controls whether Change Data Capture (CDC) is active. Enabling CDC can significantly impact system performance due to the additional overhead of tracking changes to data. This includes increased disk I/O for writing change logs, additional CPU cycles for processing these changes, and potential increases in memory usage to manage the change data structures. If this configuration is toggled, it can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
