    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly affects how much data can be cached in memory for networking operations. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk I/O operations required during data retrieval, leading to faster response times and improved throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased latency and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses and data fetching from disk. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and overall system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
