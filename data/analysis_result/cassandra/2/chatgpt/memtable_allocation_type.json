    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how memory is allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. Changing this configuration can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and garbage collection behavior. For instance, using a different allocation type may affect the speed of writes and the overall throughput of the system, as well as impact latency due to changes in how memory is managed and reclaimed. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect execution time and system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
