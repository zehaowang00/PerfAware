    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration in Cassandra significantly impacts system performance because it affects the amount of data transmitted between nodes. Enabling compression can reduce network bandwidth usage and improve throughput, but it may also increase CPU usage due to the overhead of compressing and decompressing data. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time, especially in scenarios with high inter-node communication, making it a performance-sensitive setting."
