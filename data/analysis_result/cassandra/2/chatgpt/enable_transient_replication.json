    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration in Cassandra directly affects how data is replicated across nodes in a cluster. When enabled, transient replication allows for faster writes by reducing the overhead of maintaining full replicas for transient data. However, this can lead to increased performance sensitivity, as changes in this setting can significantly impact write latency and overall throughput. If transient replication is disabled, the system may experience higher write latencies and increased resource consumption due to the need for full data replication. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
