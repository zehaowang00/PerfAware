    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching column indexes. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O by allowing more index data to be stored in memory, leading to faster query execution times. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk access, which can degrade performance, especially under heavy read workloads. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
