The operations involved are simple conditional checks and do not involve time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The retrieval of the configuration value from `DatabaseDescriptor.getInterDCTcpNoDelay()` is likely a lightweight operation, and thus, this configuration does not directly cause significant performance variations."
