            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `maxHintsFileSize` directly influences the amount of data processed in the `flushInternal` method. If this size is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage and time-consuming operations when appending data to the session, potentially causing significant delays in processing. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent interruptions in the writing process, affecting overall performance. Thus, the configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its effect on memory and processing time."
