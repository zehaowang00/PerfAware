Adjusting this value can have significant implications on the performance of data transmission, particularly in high-load scenarios where bandwidth is critical. The method `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateThroughput()` suggests that changes to this configuration can lead to immediate adjustments in how data is managed and transmitted, potentially affecting overall system performance. Therefore, this configuration can cause substantial variations in performance due to its impact on time-intensive operations related to data streaming."
