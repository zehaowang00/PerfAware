The method `maybeWaitForSync` introduces a blocking mechanism based on this configuration, meaning that if the sync lag is too high, it can cause the system to wait longer than necessary, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput. This is a critical performance aspect, as it can severely impact the overall system performance during high-load scenarios."
