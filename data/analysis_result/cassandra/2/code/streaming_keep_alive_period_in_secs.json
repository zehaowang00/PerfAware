            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs` directly influences the frequency of keep-alive tasks scheduled in the system. A shorter keep-alive period could lead to more frequent task executions, which may increase CPU usage and resource contention, especially in a high-load environment. Conversely, a longer period could lead to delayed detection of peer failures, impacting overall system responsiveness. Therefore, variations in this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance sensitive."
