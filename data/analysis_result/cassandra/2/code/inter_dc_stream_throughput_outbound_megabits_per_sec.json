            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: While the inter-data center stream throughput can affect the overall data transfer rate, the operations involved in getting and setting this configuration (i.e., fetching the current value, setting a new value, and updating the stream rate limiter) are not inherently time-intensive or memory-intensive. The operations performed are primarily simple getter and setter methods, which typically execute in constant time. Additionally, the calculation of the rate in bytes is a straightforward arithmetic operation. Therefore, changes to this configuration are unlikely to cause significant performance variations in the system."
