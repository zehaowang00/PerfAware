While garbage collection can have performance implications, the specific configuration `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` is not directly addressed in the provided code context. The operations performed here, such as querying MBeans and registering them, do not involve substantial time-intensive or memory-intensive operations that would significantly impact system performance. Therefore, this configuration does not qualify as performance-sensitive."
