If the throughput is set too low, it may lead to increased latency and resource contention, while setting it too high could overwhelm the system's I/O capabilities, leading to performance degradation. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its direct correlation with time-intensive operations during data compaction."
