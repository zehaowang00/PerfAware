It ensures that streaming is only performed when it is appropriate, thereby maintaining the integrity and consistency of data transfers.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Condition Check**: The method checks two key conditions:\n   - Whether the full SSTable transfers are enabled through the `DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables()` method.\n   - Whether the current SSTable metadata contains legacy counter shards, which may not be compatible with full streaming.\n\n2. **Return Value**: If either condition fails (i.e., streaming is disabled or legacy counter shards are present), the method returns `false`, indicating that streaming should not occur.
