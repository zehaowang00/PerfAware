Its primary purpose is to determine whether incremental backups are enabled, allowing the system to conditionally execute backup operations based on this setting.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for holding the configuration settings, including whether incremental backups are enabled. The method `isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()` checks this setting to control the flow of the backup process.\n   \n2. **SSTableReader**: This represents the data structure that holds the data to be backed up. The method `maybeIncrementallyBackup()` iterates through a collection of these readers to perform backup operations.\n\n3. **Directories**: This utility is used to retrieve the appropriate backup directory for each SSTableReader, ensuring that backups are stored in the correct location.\n\n4. **FileUtils**: This component is utilized to obtain the canonical path of the backup directory, which is necessary for creating links to the backups.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The method `maybeIncrementallyBackup()` serves as the main entry point for initiating the backup process. It first checks the configuration via `DatabaseDescriptor.isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()`. If backups are not enabled, the method exits early without performing any operations.\n- If backups are enabled, the method proceeds to create backup links for each SSTableReader by calling `createLinks()` on each instance, using the directory obtained from `Directories.getBackupsDirectory()`.\n- The `isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()` method provides a straightforward interface for other components to query the backup configuration, promoting modularity and separation of concerns within the codebase.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a critical role in managing data integrity and safety by enabling or disabling the incremental backup functionality based on the system's settings."

The configuration itself does not directly cause significant performance variations; it merely enables or disables a process. The operations performed (creating links) are not inherently memory-intensive or time-intensive enough to classify this configuration as performance-sensitive, especially since the method can exit early if backups are not enabled."
