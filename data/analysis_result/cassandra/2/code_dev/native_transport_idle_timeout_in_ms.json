Its primary role is to manage the lifecycle of connections by specifying how long a connection can remain idle before it is automatically closed.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n- **ChannelPipeline**: The configuration is integrated into the `ChannelPipeline`, which is a sequence of handlers that process inbound and outbound events for a channel. The `IdleStateHandler` is added to the pipeline to monitor the idle state of the connection.\n  \n- **IdleStateHandler**: This handler is responsible for detecting idle connections based on the specified timeout.
