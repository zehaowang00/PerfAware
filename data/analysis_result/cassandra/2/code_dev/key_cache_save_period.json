            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `key_cache_save_period` directly influences how frequently the cache's contents are saved, which can lead to significant performance impacts during high-load scenarios. If the save period is too short, it may result in frequent I/O operations that could degrade system performance due to time-intensive write operations. Conversely, a longer save period could lead to increased memory usage and potential data loss in case of failures, impacting overall system reliability and performance. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for both time and memory resources, classifying it as performance sensitive."
