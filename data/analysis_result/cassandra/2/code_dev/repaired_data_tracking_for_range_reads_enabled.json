Its primary purpose is to determine whether the system should collect and utilize information about repaired data when executing queries over a specified range of data.\n\n#### Functionality and Interaction:\n\n1. **Configuration Retrieval**: The method `getRepairedDataTrackingEnabledForRangeReads()` retrieves the current state of the configuration from the `DatabaseDescriptor`. This method acts as a gatekeeper, providing a boolean value that indicates whether repaired data tracking is enabled for range reads.\n\n2. **Conditional Logic**: Within the `query` method, the configuration is utilized to conditionally enable tracking of repaired data. Specifically, the variable `trackRepairedStatus` is set based on the configuration's state and the number of full replicas available in the `replicaPlan`. If the configuration is enabled and there are multiple full replicas, the system will track the repaired data status.\n\n3. **Integration with Query Execution**: The configuration influences the behavior of the `DataResolver` and `ReadCallback` components. If tracking is enabled, these components will be initialized with the `trackRepairedStatus` flag, which affects how they handle data resolution and callback processing during read operations.\n\n4. **Replica Interaction**: The configuration also impacts how queries are dispatched to replicas. When sending messages to replicas, the system checks if the tracking is enabled and whether the replica is a full replica. This ensures that only relevant replicas are queried for repaired data information.\n\n5. **Dependencies**: The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for its state and interacts with various components such as `ReplicaPlan`, `DataResolver`, and `ReadCallback`.
