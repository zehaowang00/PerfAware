            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec` directly influences the rate of data compaction, which is a time-intensive operation. By setting a limit on the compaction rate, this configuration can significantly impact the performance of the system, especially under heavy load or with large datasets. If the throughput is set too low, it can lead to longer compaction times, increased memory usage, and potential bottlenecks in data processing. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause substantial performance differences, classifying it as performance sensitive."
