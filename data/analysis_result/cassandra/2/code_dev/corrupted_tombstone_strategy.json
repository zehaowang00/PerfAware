This configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which retrieves the current strategy setting defined in the system's configuration.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` is to dictate how the system should respond when it detects invalid tombstones (deletions) in the data during read or compaction processes. The strategy can take one of three values: `disabled`, `warn`, or `exception`. \n\n- **Disabled**: If the strategy is set to `disabled`, the system will not perform any validation on the `Unfiltered` data, effectively ignoring any potential issues.\n- **Warn**: If set to `warn`, the system will log a warning message when it encounters invalid deletions, allowing for monitoring without interrupting the process.\n- **Exception**: If the strategy is set to `exception`, the system will throw a `CorruptSSTableException`, marking the affected `SSTableReader` as suspect to prevent it from being used in future operations. This ensures that corrupt data does not propagate through the system.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies\nThe configuration interacts with several key components:\n- **`Unfiltered`**: Represents the data structure that may contain invalid deletions.\n- **`TableMetadata`**: Provides metadata about the table, including its schema and partitioning information.\n- **`DecoratedKey`**: Represents the key for the data being validated, which is essential for identifying the specific data entry in question.\n- **`SSTableReader`**: Represents the data file being read, which can be marked as suspect if invalid deletions are detected.\n\nThe `maybeValidateUnfiltered` method is responsible for checking the `Unfiltered` data against the strategy defined by `corrupted_tombstone_strategy`. If invalid deletions are found, it delegates the handling of these issues to the `handleInvalid` method, which implements the logic based on the current strategy.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\nThe configuration is integral to the data validation process, ensuring that the system can respond appropriately to data integrity issues. By determining the strategy for handling corrupted tombstones, it influences how the system logs errors, raises exceptions, and marks data as suspect. This configuration thus serves as a safeguard for maintaining data integrity within the broader architecture of the system, ensuring that invalid data does not compromise the reliability of data operations."
