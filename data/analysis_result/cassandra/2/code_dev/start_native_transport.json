If this property is set to `true`, or if it is not set (null) and the default behavior (as defined in `DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport()`) is to start the native transport, the method proceeds to invoke `startNativeTransport()`.\n- **Service Initialization**: Upon starting the native transport, the method also marks the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service as ready by calling `StorageService.instance.setRpcReady(true)`. This indicates that the system is prepared to handle RPC requests.\n\n### Dependencies and Key Components:\n- **System Property**: The configuration relies on the Java system property mechanism to determine its value, allowing for flexible configuration at runtime.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for providing the default behavior for starting the native transport when the property is not explicitly set.\n- **StorageService**: This component is integral to managing the state of the RPC service within Cassandra, ensuring that it is ready to handle incoming requests once the native transport is started.\n\n### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts with the `startNativeTransport` method, which is responsible for the actual initialization of the native transport layer.\n- It also provides feedback through logging if the native transport is not started, guiding users to utilize JMX or nodetool for manual control.\n\nIn summary, the `start_native_transport` configuration is essential for controlling the initialization of the native transport service in Cassandra, with dependencies on system properties and interactions with key components like `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StorageService`."
