This configuration plays a crucial role in determining how long a connection can remain idle before being terminated, thus ensuring efficient resource utilization.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **ConnectionCategory Enum**: This configuration relies on the `ConnectionCategory` enum, which distinguishes between different types of connections (e.g., MESSAGING and STREAMING). The behavior of the timeout setting varies based on the category specified.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor Class**: The configuration interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to retrieve the appropriate timeout values. It calls methods like `getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()` and `getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()` to fetch the respective timeout settings based on the connection category.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `tcpUserTimeoutInMS` method checks if a previously set timeout value exists; if not, it determines the timeout based on the connection category. This method encapsulates the logic for selecting the correct timeout value, ensuring that the system can handle different types of connections appropriately.\n- The `getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS` method serves as a direct accessor for the timeout value, allowing other components of the system to retrieve the internode TCP user timeout configuration without needing to understand the underlying logic of connection categories.\n\nOverall, this configuration is integral to managing connection lifetimes in the system, facilitating communication between nodes while adhering to specified timeout policies."
