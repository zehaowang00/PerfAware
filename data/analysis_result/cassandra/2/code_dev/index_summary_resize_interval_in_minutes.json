            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes` directly affects how frequently the index summary's memory allocation is adjusted, which can lead to significant variations in memory usage and performance. If the interval is set too short, it may cause frequent resizing operations that are time-intensive and could lead to increased memory overhead, impacting overall system performance. Conversely, if set too long, it may result in suboptimal memory allocation, leading to performance degradation during data operations. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its influence on memory management and operational efficiency."
