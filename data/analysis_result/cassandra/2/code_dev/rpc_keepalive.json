It is utilized in the creation of a `PipelineConfigurator`, which is responsible for setting up the network pipeline for handling incoming and outgoing data. This configuration ensures that the server maintains active connections by sending periodic keepalive signals, which helps in detecting and managing idle connections effectively.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Builder Pattern**: The `Server` constructor uses a `Builder` object to gather various configurations, including `tlsEncryptionPolicy` and `pipelineConfigurator`. This pattern allows for flexible and readable object creation.\n- **PipelineConfigurator**: If the `pipelineConfigurator` is not provided in the builder, a new instance is created using the `useEpoll` flag, along with the `rpc_keepalive` value obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor`. This indicates that the keepalive setting is integral to the pipeline's behavior.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class provides access to configuration values such as `getRpcKeepAlive()`, which retrieves the specific keepalive setting for RPC (Remote Procedure Call) connections. This dependency highlights the interaction between the server and the database layer.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `rpc_keepalive` setting is indirectly linked to the overall connection management strategy of the server. By being part of the `PipelineConfigurator`, it influences how the server handles client connections, ensuring they remain active and responsive. This configuration interacts with the `tlsEncryptionPolicy` to ensure secure communication while maintaining connection integrity.\n\nIn summary, the `rpc_keepalive` configuration is essential for managing connection lifecycles within the server, ensuring that idle connections are monitored and maintained effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the server's communication capabilities."
