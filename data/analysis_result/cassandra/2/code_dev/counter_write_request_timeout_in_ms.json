If the timeout is set too high, it could lead to prolonged waiting periods for operations that may ultimately fail, causing delays in processing and resource allocation. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to premature timeouts, resulting in failed operations and potential data inconsistency. Given that these timeout settings can significantly affect the responsiveness and throughput of the system, they are classified as performance-sensitive."
