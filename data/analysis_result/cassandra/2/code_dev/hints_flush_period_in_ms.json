            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `hints_flush_period_in_ms` directly influences the frequency of flushing operations on the hints buffer pool, which can be time-intensive depending on the size of the data being processed. If the flush period is set too long, it may lead to increased memory usage as the buffer fills up, potentially causing delays in data processing and impacting overall system responsiveness. Conversely, if set too short, it could lead to excessive flushing, which may degrade performance due to frequent context switching and resource contention. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance sensitive."
