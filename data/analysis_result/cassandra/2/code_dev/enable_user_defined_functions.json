This configuration is defined in the `cassandra.yaml` file and is essential for enabling custom logic to be executed in database queries.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `enable_user_defined_functions` setting is to allow or restrict the use of UDFs in Cassandra. When set to `true`, it enables developers to create and execute custom functions that can enhance the functionality of the database by allowing for more complex data processing directly within queries.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe method `assertUdfsEnabled(String language)` checks the status of this configuration. If UDFs are not enabled (i.e., the configuration is set to `false`), the method throws an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that UDFs are disabled and providing guidance on how to enable them in the configuration file.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for reading and managing the configuration settings from the `cassandra.yaml` file. The method `enableUserDefinedFunctions()` is a static method that checks the current state of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration.\n- **InvalidRequestException**: This exception is thrown to signal an invalid operation when UDFs are attempted to be used while they are disabled. This interaction ensures that the system enforces the configuration rules effectively.\n\nOverall, the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration is a key component that governs the use of UDFs, ensuring that developers are aware of the current settings and can modify them as needed for their applications."
