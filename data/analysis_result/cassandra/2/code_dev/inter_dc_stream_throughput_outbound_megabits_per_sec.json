This setting plays a crucial role in defining the maximum data transfer rate allowed for outbound streams between data centers, ensuring that data flows are controlled and can be adjusted as needed.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the primary interface for accessing and modifying the inter-DC stream throughput configuration. It provides methods to get and set the current throughput value.\n   - `getInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec()`: Retrieves the current throughput setting.\n   - `setInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec(int value)`: Updates the throughput setting to a new value.\n\n2. **StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter**: This component is responsible for enforcing the throughput limits set by the configuration. When the throughput value is changed, the `updateInterDCThroughput()` method is called to apply the new settings, ensuring that the system adheres to the defined limits.\n\n3. **Logging**: The configuration changes are logged for tracking purposes, providing information about the old and new throughput values whenever a change is made.
