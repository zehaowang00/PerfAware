Different allocation strategies can lead to significant variations in memory usage and performance, especially under heavy write loads. For instance, using off-heap memory can reduce garbage collection overhead and improve performance in memory-intensive scenarios, while inappropriate allocation types may lead to increased latency and resource contention. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance, making it performance sensitive."
