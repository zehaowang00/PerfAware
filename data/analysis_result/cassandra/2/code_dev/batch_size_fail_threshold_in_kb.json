This configuration is accessed through the method `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()`, which retrieves the value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for managing various database-related configurations, including the batch size failure threshold. It serves as the source of truth for retrieving configuration values.\n- **Method**: The `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()` method acts as an interface for other parts of the system to obtain the current threshold value.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe retrieved threshold value can be utilized by various components that handle batch processing within the system. By providing a centralized method for accessing this configuration, the system ensures that any changes to the threshold are consistently reflected wherever this method is called. This promotes maintainability and reduces the risk of discrepancies in the threshold value across different modules.\n\nOverall, the `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb` configuration plays a crucial role in defining acceptable limits for batch processing, ensuring that the system can manage data efficiently while adhering to predefined constraints."
