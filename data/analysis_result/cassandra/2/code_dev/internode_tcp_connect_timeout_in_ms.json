This configuration plays a crucial role in managing how long the system will wait for a connection to be established before timing out.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **Method `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**:\n   - This method checks if a local variable `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS` is set. If it is not null, it returns this value. If it is null, it falls back to the value provided by the `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()` method.\n   - This dual approach allows for flexibility in configuration, enabling the use of a default value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` if a specific timeout is not defined.\n\n2. **Method `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**:\n   - This method directly retrieves the internode TCP connect timeout value from the `DatabaseDescriptor`. It serves as a straightforward accessor for the default configuration.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which presumably contains the default settings for various system parameters, including the internode TCP connect timeout. This indicates that the configuration is part of a larger framework where various settings are centralized in the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` configuration interacts with the networking components of the system, specifically in establishing connections between different nodes. By determining the timeout duration, it influences how the system handles connectivity issues and retries during node communication.\n\nOverall, this configuration is essential for ensuring reliable communication between nodes in a distributed environment, providing a mechanism to define and retrieve connection timeout settings."
