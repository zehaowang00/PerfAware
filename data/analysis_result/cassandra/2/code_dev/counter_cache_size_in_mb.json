A larger cache can lead to significant memory consumption, which may impact overall system performance, especially if the cache size approaches system memory limits. Additionally, the cache's behavior, including its save frequency and the number of keys to save, can lead to time-intensive operations if not managed properly. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause substantial performance differences in terms of memory usage and operational latency."
