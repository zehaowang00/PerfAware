Its primary function is to provide a configurable buffer size that can be set explicitly or default to a value defined in the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n\n### Key Components and Interactions:\n- **Local Variable**: The method checks if the local variable `socketSendBufferSizeInBytes` is not null. If it has been set, it returns this value.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor Dependency**: If the local variable is null, the method retrieves the default buffer size from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class using the method `getInternodeSocketSendBufferSizeInBytes()`. This establishes a dependency on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for the default configuration.\n\n### Purpose:\nThis configuration allows flexibility in defining the socket send buffer size, enabling the system to adapt to different operational requirements. By allowing a configurable value, the system can accommodate various network conditions or application needs, while still providing a sensible default through the `DatabaseDescriptor`. This interaction ensures that the system can maintain effective communication between nodes, relying on either a custom or a default buffer size."
