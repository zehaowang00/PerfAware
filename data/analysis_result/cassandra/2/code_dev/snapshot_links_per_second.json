The method `getSnapshotLinksPerSecond()` within this class is the source of the configuration value, indicating that it is dependent on the database's configuration management.\n- **Method Interaction**: The `getSnapshotLinksPerSecond()` method acts as a bridge between the configuration stored in the `DatabaseDescriptor` and other parts of the system that require this specific rate value.\n\n### Functional Role:\nThe primary purpose of the `snapshot_links_per_second` configuration is to define the permissible rate for processing snapshot links, which is essential for maintaining the system's operational flow. By centralizing this configuration in the `DatabaseDescriptor`, the system ensures that any changes to the rate can be managed and updated in a single location, promoting maintainability and clarity within the codebase.
