If the timeout is set too low, it may lead to frequent timeouts, causing operations to fail and potentially requiring retries, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to prolonged waiting periods for operations that are stuck, affecting system responsiveness. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its influence on the duration of time-intensive operations."
