    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a response from a request before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent timeouts, causing increased retries and potentially higher resource consumption, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timeout may lead to longer wait times for users, affecting perceived performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
