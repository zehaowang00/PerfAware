    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of cached rows that can fail before the system takes corrective action. A change in this threshold can significantly affect the performance of read operations, as it directly influences how the system handles cache misses and the efficiency of data retrieval. If set too low, it may lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times due to frequent cache evictions, while a value set too high may lead to excessive memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors. Thus, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
