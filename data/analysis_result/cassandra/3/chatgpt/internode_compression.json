    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the amount of data transmitted between nodes. Enabling compression can significantly reduce the network bandwidth usage and improve the speed of data transfer, which in turn affects overall execution time and latency during read and write operations. Conversely, disabling compression may lead to increased data size and slower performance due to higher network traffic and increased I/O operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
