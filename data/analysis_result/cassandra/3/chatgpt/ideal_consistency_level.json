    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the consistency and availability of data across distributed nodes. Changing this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, as higher consistency levels may require more coordination between nodes, resulting in increased latency and potential timeouts. Additionally, it can affect memory consumption due to the overhead of maintaining more stringent consistency guarantees. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably influence overall system performance."
