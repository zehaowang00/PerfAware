    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_large_partition_warning_threshold_mb' in Cassandra determines the threshold size for warning about large partitions during compaction. If this threshold is set too high, it may lead to performance degradation due to inefficient compaction processes, potentially causing increased memory consumption and longer execution times for read and write operations. Conversely, setting it too low could trigger excessive warnings and compactions, leading to overhead and resource contention. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
