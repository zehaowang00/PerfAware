    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is flushed to the storage layer. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in the frequency and size of flush operations, which can significantly impact disk I/O performance, memory usage, and overall latency of read and write operations. If the flush is done in larger batches, it may reduce the number of I/O operations but can increase memory consumption, while smaller batches may lead to more frequent flushes, affecting execution time and throughput. Therefore, tuning this parameter can have a considerable effect on the system's performance metrics."
