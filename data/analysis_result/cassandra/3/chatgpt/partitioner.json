    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. A change in the partitioner can lead to significant variations in data distribution, which directly impacts read and write performance, load balancing, and overall system efficiency. For instance, using a different partitioning strategy can result in uneven data distribution, leading to hotspots and increased latency during data access. Additionally, it can affect memory consumption and disk I/O patterns, further influencing system performance. Therefore, this configuration is deemed performance-sensitive."
