    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' directly impacts the rate at which data can be streamed out of the Cassandra nodes. A higher value allows for increased data transfer rates, which can significantly reduce execution time for read and write operations, especially in high-load scenarios. Conversely, lowering this value can lead to bottlenecks, increased latency, and higher memory consumption due to queuing of data. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
