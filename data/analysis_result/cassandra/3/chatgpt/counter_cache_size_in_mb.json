    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching counter values. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially under heavy write loads. If the cache size is too small, it can result in increased disk I/O as counters are frequently evicted from the cache, leading to slower read and write operations. Conversely, allocating too much memory to the counter cache can reduce the available memory for other operations, potentially leading to increased garbage collection pauses and overall system performance degradation. Therefore, the performance sensitivity of this configuration is critical to maintaining optimal performance in a Cassandra deployment."
