    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the ability of the system to handle client connections and requests. When enabled, it allows for native transport protocol communication, which can significantly improve throughput and reduce latency for client interactions. Conversely, if disabled, the system may experience increased execution times and higher resource consumption due to the fallback to a less efficient protocol. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it a critical parameter for performance tuning."
