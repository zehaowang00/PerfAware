    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact system performance because it controls the logging of audit events. If enabled with extensive logging, it can lead to increased I/O operations and higher disk usage, which may result in slower response times and increased latency during data operations. Additionally, excessive logging can consume more CPU and memory resources, further affecting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption."
