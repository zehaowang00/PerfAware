    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'prepared_statements_cache_size_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the caching of prepared statements, which can significantly impact query execution performance. A larger cache size can reduce the overhead of preparing statements multiple times, leading to faster execution times and lower latency for repeated queries. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased preparation time and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses, thereby affecting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
