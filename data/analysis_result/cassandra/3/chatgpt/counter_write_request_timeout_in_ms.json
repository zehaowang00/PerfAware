    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly affects the timeout duration for write requests involving counters. If this value is set too low, it may lead to frequent timeouts, causing retries and increased latency, which can significantly degrade overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to resource contention and delayed error detection, also negatively impacting performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and system responsiveness."
