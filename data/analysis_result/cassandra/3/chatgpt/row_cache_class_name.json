    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration in Cassandra determines the implementation of the row cache, which can significantly impact the performance of read operations. A change in this configuration can lead to variations in how data is cached and retrieved, affecting execution time and memory consumption. For instance, using a more efficient caching strategy can reduce latency and improve throughput, while a less efficient one can lead to increased resource usage and slower response times. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as its value change can notably affect system performance."
