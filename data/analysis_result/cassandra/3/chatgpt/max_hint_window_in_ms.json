    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum time window for which hints are retained for nodes that are temporarily unavailable. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving node failures or network partitions. If the window is set too low, hints may be dropped before they can be applied, leading to increased read latency and potential data inconsistency. Conversely, a very high value may lead to excessive memory consumption as hints accumulate, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
