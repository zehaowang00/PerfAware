    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'trickle_fsync_interval_in_kb' in Cassandra affects how frequently data is flushed to disk, which directly impacts I/O operations. A lower value may lead to more frequent flushes, increasing disk I/O and potentially slowing down overall system performance due to higher contention and latency. Conversely, a higher value could reduce the frequency of flushes, leading to increased memory consumption and possible data loss in the event of a crash. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly influence execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
