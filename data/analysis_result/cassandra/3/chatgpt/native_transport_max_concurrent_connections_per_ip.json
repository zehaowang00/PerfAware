    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' in Cassandra directly influences the number of simultaneous connections that can be handled from a single IP address. A higher number of concurrent connections can lead to increased resource utilization, such as CPU and memory consumption, as well as potential contention for I/O operations. If this value is set too low, it may result in connection throttling, causing delays and increased execution time for client requests. Conversely, setting it too high can overwhelm the system, leading to performance degradation. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
