    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts how data is written to disk. When enabled, it can significantly reduce the amount of disk space used and improve I/O performance by compressing data before flushing it to disk. Conversely, if disabled, the system may experience increased disk usage and slower write operations due to larger data sizes being written without compression. This change can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, particularly under heavy write loads, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
