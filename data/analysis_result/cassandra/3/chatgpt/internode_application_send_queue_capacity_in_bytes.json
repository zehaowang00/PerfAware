    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra directly affects the capacity of the send queue for internode communication. A change in this value can lead to variations in how data is buffered and transmitted between nodes, impacting overall throughput and latency. If the queue capacity is too low, it can result in increased backpressure, leading to delays in data processing and higher execution times. Conversely, a very high capacity may lead to increased memory consumption and potential garbage collection issues, affecting performance. Therefore, this configuration is critical for optimizing the performance of data replication and communication in a distributed system like Cassandra."
