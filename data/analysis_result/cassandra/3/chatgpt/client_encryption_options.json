    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the overhead associated with encrypting and decrypting data during client-server communication. Changes in encryption algorithms, key sizes, or modes can lead to significant variations in CPU utilization, latency, and overall throughput. For instance, stronger encryption methods may enhance security but can also increase execution time and memory consumption due to the additional computational resources required. Therefore, any modifications to this configuration can substantially affect the performance characteristics of the system."
