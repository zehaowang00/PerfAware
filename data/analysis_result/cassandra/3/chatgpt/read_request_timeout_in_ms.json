    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system will wait for a read operation to complete before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent timeouts, resulting in increased retries and potentially higher resource consumption, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timeout value may allow for longer operations to complete, but can also lead to increased latency for users if operations are delayed. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
