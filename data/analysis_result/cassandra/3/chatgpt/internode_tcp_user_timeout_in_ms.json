    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value can lead to quicker detection of unresponsive nodes, which can improve the responsiveness of the system under certain failure conditions. Conversely, a higher timeout value may delay the detection of issues, potentially causing longer execution times for operations that depend on inter-node communication. This can lead to increased memory consumption as the system waits for responses that may never arrive, impacting overall performance and stability. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly influence system performance metrics."
