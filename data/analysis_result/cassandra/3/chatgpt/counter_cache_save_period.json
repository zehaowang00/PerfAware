    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the counter cache is saved to disk. A shorter save period can lead to more frequent disk writes, which can significantly impact I/O performance and overall system throughput, especially under heavy write loads. Conversely, a longer save period may reduce disk I/O but increase the risk of losing counter updates in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
