    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the distribution of data across the nodes in a cluster. A change in its value can lead to uneven data distribution, which can cause some nodes to handle significantly more data than others. This imbalance can result in increased execution times for read and write operations, higher memory consumption on overloaded nodes, and potential bottlenecks in data access patterns. Therefore, variations in the 'initial_token' setting can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
