    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' in Cassandra directly influences how tokens are allocated across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this configuration can significantly affect data distribution, load balancing, and overall cluster performance. If the token allocation is not optimal, it can lead to uneven data distribution, which may cause some nodes to become hotspots, resulting in increased latency and resource consumption. This can notably impact execution time and memory usage, especially in large-scale deployments where efficient data distribution is critical for maintaining performance."
