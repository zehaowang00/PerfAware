    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for the number of keyspaces that can be created before a warning is issued. A change in this threshold can significantly impact system performance by affecting resource allocation and management. If the threshold is set too high, it may lead to an excessive number of keyspaces, which can increase memory consumption and slow down query performance due to the overhead of managing many keyspaces. Conversely, setting it too low may restrict the application's ability to scale, leading to performance bottlenecks. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
