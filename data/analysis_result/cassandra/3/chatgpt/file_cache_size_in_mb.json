    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching file data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O operations by allowing more data to be stored in memory, which leads to faster read times and improved overall system performance. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk access, causing higher latency and slower execution times. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on performance metrics such as execution time and memory consumption."
