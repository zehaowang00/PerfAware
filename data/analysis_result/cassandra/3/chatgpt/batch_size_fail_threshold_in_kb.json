    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' in Cassandra directly influences how the system handles batch operations. A change in this threshold can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption during batch processing. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to frequent failures of batch operations, causing retries and increased latency. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system behavior and performance metrics."
