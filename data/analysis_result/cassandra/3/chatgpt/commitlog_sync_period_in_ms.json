    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the commit log is flushed to disk. A shorter sync period can lead to more frequent disk I/O operations, which can significantly reduce the risk of data loss but may also increase latency and impact overall throughput due to the overhead of these operations. Conversely, a longer sync period can improve performance by reducing the frequency of disk writes but increases the risk of data loss in the event of a crash. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
