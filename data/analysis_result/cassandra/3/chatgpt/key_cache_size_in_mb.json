    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the efficiency of data retrieval operations. A larger key cache size allows more keys to be stored in memory, reducing the need for disk access, which can significantly decrease execution time for read operations. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased disk I/O, resulting in higher latency and lower throughput. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, particularly under heavy read workloads."
