    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the I/O operations and storage efficiency of the commit log. Changing the compression settings can lead to significant variations in disk space usage and the speed of write operations. If compression is enabled, it reduces the amount of data written to disk, which can improve overall throughput and decrease latency during write-heavy workloads. Conversely, disabling compression may lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times, particularly in scenarios with high write volumes. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
