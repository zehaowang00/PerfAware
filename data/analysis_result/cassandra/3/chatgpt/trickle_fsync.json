    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync' configuration in Cassandra controls how frequently data is flushed to disk. A change in this setting can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of write latency and overall throughput. If the value is set too low, it may lead to increased disk I/O operations, causing higher execution times and potential bottlenecks. Conversely, setting it too high could delay data persistence, risking data loss in case of a crash. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
