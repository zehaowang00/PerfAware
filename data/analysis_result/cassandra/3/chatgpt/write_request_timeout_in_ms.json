    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the time allowed for write operations to complete before timing out. A lower timeout can lead to increased failure rates for write requests, especially under high load or when the system experiences latency. Conversely, a higher timeout may allow more writes to succeed but can also lead to longer wait times for clients, impacting overall throughput and responsiveness. Thus, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
