    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to failures during commit operations. Changing this policy can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving write-heavy workloads. For instance, setting a more lenient policy may lead to increased latency and resource consumption due to retries or additional logging, while a stricter policy could enhance performance by reducing overhead but may risk data consistency. Therefore, the value of this configuration directly influences execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
