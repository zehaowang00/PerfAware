    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in Cassandra directly influences how tokens are allocated for data replication across nodes. Changes to this setting can significantly impact data distribution and load balancing within the cluster. If the value is altered, it can lead to uneven data distribution, which may cause some nodes to become overloaded while others are underutilized. This imbalance can result in increased execution times for read and write operations, as well as higher memory consumption due to inefficient data access patterns. Therefore, this configuration is deemed performance-sensitive as it can lead to notable variations in overall system performance."
