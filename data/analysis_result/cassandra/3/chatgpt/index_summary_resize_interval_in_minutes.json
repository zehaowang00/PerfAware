    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' configuration in Cassandra controls how often the index summary is resized. A change in this interval can significantly impact the performance of read operations, as it determines the frequency of index summary updates. If the interval is too short, it may lead to increased overhead from frequent resizing, resulting in higher CPU and memory usage. Conversely, if the interval is too long, it can lead to inefficient memory usage and slower read performance due to stale index summaries. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
