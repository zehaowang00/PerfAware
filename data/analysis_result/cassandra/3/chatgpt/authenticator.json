    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the authentication mechanism used for client connections. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, particularly under heavy load or when using different authentication methods (e.g., allowing or disallowing certain authentication protocols). For instance, switching from a simple password-based authentication to a more complex mechanism like Kerberos can increase the overhead of authentication processes, thereby affecting overall system performance. Additionally, improper configuration could lead to increased memory consumption due to the handling of authentication tokens and sessions, further impacting the performance of the system."
