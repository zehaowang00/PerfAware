    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles disk failures, which can significantly affect data availability and recovery times. A change in this policy can lead to variations in execution time, especially during write operations or when a disk failure occurs. For instance, if the policy is set to 'stop' on failure, the system may halt operations, leading to increased downtime and latency. Conversely, a policy that allows for more aggressive recovery strategies can improve performance under failure conditions but may increase resource consumption. Therefore, the choice of disk failure policy can have a notable impact on overall system performance and resource utilization."
