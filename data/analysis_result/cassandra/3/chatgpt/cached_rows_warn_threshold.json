    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for warning about the number of cached rows. A change in this value can significantly impact performance by affecting how much data is cached in memory versus how much is read from disk. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive warnings and potentially unnecessary cache evictions, resulting in increased disk I/O and slower query performance. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause memory pressure and lead to out-of-memory errors. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
