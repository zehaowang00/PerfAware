    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the behavior of the dynamic snitching mechanism, which is responsible for optimizing read and write performance by selecting the best replica for requests based on their responsiveness. A change in this threshold can significantly alter how the system evaluates the performance of nodes in the cluster, leading to variations in execution time and overall throughput. If the threshold is set too low, the snitch may frequently switch to less optimal replicas, increasing latency. Conversely, if set too high, it may ignore underperforming nodes, potentially leading to uneven load distribution and degraded performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance."
