    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations before data is flushed to disk. A change in this configuration can significantly affect system performance; for instance, increasing the heap space allows for more data to be held in memory, reducing the frequency of disk writes and improving write performance. Conversely, if the heap space is set too low, it can lead to increased garbage collection, higher latency, and potential out-of-memory errors, all of which can severely degrade system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
