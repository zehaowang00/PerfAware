    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging slow queries. If this value is set too high, it may lead to increased resource consumption as more queries are logged, which can significantly affect disk I/O and memory usage. Conversely, setting it too low may result in important slow queries not being logged, hindering performance analysis and optimization efforts. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
