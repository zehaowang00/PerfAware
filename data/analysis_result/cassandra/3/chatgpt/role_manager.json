    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in Cassandra is critical for managing user roles and permissions, which directly impacts access control and data security. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in scenarios involving role validation and permission checks. If the configuration is misconfigured or altered, it could result in increased latency for queries or even access denial, thereby affecting overall system performance and user experience."
