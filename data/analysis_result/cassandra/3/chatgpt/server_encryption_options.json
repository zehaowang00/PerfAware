    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the overhead associated with data encryption and decryption processes. Changes in encryption algorithms or key sizes can lead to significant variations in execution time and CPU usage, as encryption operations are computationally intensive. Additionally, improper configurations may lead to increased memory consumption due to buffering and processing of encrypted data, affecting overall system performance and throughput. Therefore, any modifications to this configuration can have a notable effect on the performance of the Cassandra database system."
