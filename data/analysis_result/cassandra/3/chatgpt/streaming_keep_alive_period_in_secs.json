    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration in Cassandra affects the duration that streaming connections remain open during data transfer operations. A shorter keep-alive period can lead to increased connection overhead and potentially more frequent reconnections, which may degrade performance during large data streaming tasks. Conversely, a longer keep-alive period can enhance throughput by reducing the frequency of connection setup and teardown, thus impacting execution time and resource utilization significantly. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance."
