    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this feature can significantly impact the efficiency of read operations. When this configuration is enabled, the system tracks repaired data for range reads, which can lead to increased overhead in terms of memory usage and processing time. If this tracking is not managed properly, it can result in longer execution times for read queries, especially in large datasets where data consistency is critical. Additionally, the change in this configuration can affect the overall throughput of the system, as it may require additional resources to maintain the integrity of the data during reads. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance."
