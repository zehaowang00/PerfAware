    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration in Cassandra allows users to define custom functions that can be executed within the database. Enabling this feature can significantly impact system performance because user-defined functions can introduce additional computational overhead, affect query execution time, and increase memory consumption due to the complexity and resource demands of the custom logic being executed. If the functions are poorly optimized or if they operate on large datasets, the performance degradation can be substantial, leading to longer response times and increased load on the system."
