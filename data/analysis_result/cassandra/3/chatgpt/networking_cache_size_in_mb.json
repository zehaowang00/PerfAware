    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching network-related data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk I/O operations required during data retrieval, leading to faster execution times and improved throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased latency and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses, which can severely impact overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
