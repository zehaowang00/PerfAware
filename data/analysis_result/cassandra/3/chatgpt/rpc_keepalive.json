    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'rpc_keepalive' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the behavior of network connections between nodes. If the keepalive interval is set too high, it may lead to increased latency in detecting dead connections, which can result in longer execution times for RPC calls. Conversely, a very low keepalive interval can lead to excessive network traffic and resource consumption, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact the responsiveness and resource utilization of the system."
