    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' directly influences the capacity of the send queue used for inter-node communication in Cassandra. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in how much data can be buffered before being sent to other nodes. If the capacity is too low, it may result in increased latency and reduced throughput due to frequent blocking or dropping of messages, especially under high load conditions. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially affecting the overall performance of the system. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
