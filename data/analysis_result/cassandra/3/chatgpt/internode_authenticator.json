    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the authentication process between nodes in a distributed system. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in the overhead associated with authentication, which, in turn, affects the latency of inter-node communication. If the authenticator is set to a more complex mechanism, it may increase the time taken for nodes to establish connections, thereby affecting overall system throughput and response times. Conversely, a simpler authenticator may reduce this overhead, leading to improved performance. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can significantly influence execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
