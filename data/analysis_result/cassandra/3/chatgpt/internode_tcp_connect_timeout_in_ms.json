    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the time taken for nodes to establish connections with each other. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker failure detection and retries, which can significantly impact the overall latency and throughput of the system, especially in a distributed environment. Conversely, a higher timeout can lead to prolonged waits for connection attempts, potentially causing delays in data replication and query processing. Such variations can notably affect execution time and resource utilization, making this configuration critical for performance tuning."
