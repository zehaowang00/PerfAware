    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra directly impacts the timeout settings for TCP connections between nodes. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in how long the system waits for responses from other nodes during data streaming operations. If the timeout is set too low, it may result in premature termination of connections, leading to increased retries and potential data inconsistency, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to resource contention and delayed responses, affecting the throughput and latency of the system. Thus, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it can notably influence execution time and resource utilization in a distributed environment."
