    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching column indexes. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O by keeping more index data in memory, which leads to faster query execution times. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk accesses, causing notable variations in execution time and overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
