    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_hints_delivery_threads' configuration in Cassandra controls the number of threads dedicated to delivering hints to nodes that were down during writes. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance because if set too low, it can lead to delays in hint delivery, causing increased latency in read and write operations. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive context switching and resource contention, negatively affecting overall throughput. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly influence execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
