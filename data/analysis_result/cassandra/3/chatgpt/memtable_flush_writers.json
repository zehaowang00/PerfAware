    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_flush_writers' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of threads responsible for flushing memtables to disk. A change in this value can significantly impact the system's write performance and overall throughput. If set too low, it can lead to increased latency in write operations, as memtables will not be flushed quickly enough, causing them to grow larger and potentially leading to out-of-memory errors. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive disk I/O, which may degrade performance due to contention for disk resources. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
