    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or modifying encryption settings can significantly impact the system's I/O performance and CPU usage. Encryption processes require additional computational resources, which can lead to increased execution time for read and write operations. Furthermore, depending on the encryption algorithm and key management practices, there may be variations in memory consumption and latency, particularly in high-throughput environments. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in overall system performance."
