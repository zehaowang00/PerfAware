    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly affects the amount of disk space allocated for commit logs. If this value is set too low, it can lead to frequent commit log rollovers, increased I/O operations, and potential performance degradation due to the need for more frequent flushing of data to disk. Conversely, setting this value too high can lead to inefficient use of disk space and may impact the overall system performance due to increased garbage collection times. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
