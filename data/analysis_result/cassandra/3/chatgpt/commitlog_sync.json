    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. A change in its value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of write latency and throughput. If set to 'batch', the system may experience lower write performance due to the increased time between flushes, while setting it to 'periodic' can lead to more frequent disk I/O operations, potentially increasing latency during high write loads. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
