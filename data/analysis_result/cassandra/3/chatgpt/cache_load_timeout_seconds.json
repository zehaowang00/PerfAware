    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for cache loading operations to complete. A lower timeout may lead to premature termination of cache loading, resulting in increased cache misses and higher latency for read operations. Conversely, a higher timeout can lead to prolonged resource usage, potentially causing delays in other operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
