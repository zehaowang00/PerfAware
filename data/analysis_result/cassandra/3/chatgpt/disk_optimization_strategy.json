    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_optimization_strategy' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to and read from disk. Different strategies can lead to significant variations in I/O operations, affecting both execution time and memory consumption. For instance, using a strategy that prioritizes write performance may reduce read efficiency, leading to longer query response times. Conversely, a strategy focused on read optimization may increase write latencies. Therefore, changes in this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
