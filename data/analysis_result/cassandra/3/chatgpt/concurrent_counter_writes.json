    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how many simultaneous writes can occur to counter columns. Increasing this value can lead to improved throughput and reduced contention among write operations, significantly impacting execution time and overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too low can result in bottlenecks, increased latency, and higher resource consumption due to queuing. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in performance metrics, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
