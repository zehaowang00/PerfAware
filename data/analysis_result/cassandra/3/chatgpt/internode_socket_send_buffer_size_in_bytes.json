    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the network communication between nodes in the cluster. A larger send buffer can improve throughput by allowing more data to be sent before waiting for acknowledgments, thus reducing latency and increasing overall performance during high-load scenarios. Conversely, a smaller buffer size may lead to increased packet loss and retransmissions, negatively impacting execution time and resource utilization. Therefore, variations in this configuration can significantly influence system performance, making it a critical parameter to optimize."
