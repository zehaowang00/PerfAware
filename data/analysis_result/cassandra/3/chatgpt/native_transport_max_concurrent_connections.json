    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections' in Cassandra determines the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be handled by the native transport layer. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, as increasing the limit allows more clients to connect simultaneously, which can lead to higher throughput and reduced latency under load. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to connection bottlenecks, causing increased response times and degraded performance for users. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly affect the execution time and resource utilization of the system."
