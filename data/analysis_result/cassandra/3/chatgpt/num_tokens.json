    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of tokens assigned to a node in a ring topology. A change in this value can significantly impact data distribution, load balancing, and partitioning across the cluster. If 'num_tokens' is set too low, it can lead to uneven data distribution, causing some nodes to become overloaded while others are underutilized, which can increase execution time and memory consumption due to inefficient resource usage. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to increased overhead in managing tokens and potentially degrade performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect system performance."
