    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how many write operations can be processed simultaneously. A higher value allows more concurrent writes, which can significantly enhance throughput and reduce latency under high load conditions. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks, increased execution time for write operations, and inefficient use of system resources. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
