If this size is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage and potentially slow down the system due to increased garbage collection or memory pressure. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent interruptions in processing, causing performance degradation. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its influence on memory usage and processing efficiency."
