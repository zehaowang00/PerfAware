If the interval is set too low, it may lead to frequent opening and closing of SSTables, causing increased I/O operations and memory usage. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption, affecting overall system responsiveness. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for both time-intensive and memory-intensive operations in the system."
