            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `hints_flush_period_in_ms` directly influences the frequency at which the buffer pool is flushed. A longer flush period may lead to increased memory usage as more data accumulates in the buffer, potentially causing delays in processing and higher latency. Conversely, a shorter flush period may increase CPU usage due to more frequent flush operations. The impact of this configuration on system performance is significant, as it can lead to either memory exhaustion or increased processing overhead, both of which can severely affect overall system responsiveness and throughput."
