The throughput value is merely retrieved or updated in the database descriptor without significant overhead. Additionally, the calculation of the inter-data center rate in bytes is a straightforward arithmetic operation that does not introduce substantial performance variations, even if it is called frequently. Thus, it does not qualify as performance-sensitive."
