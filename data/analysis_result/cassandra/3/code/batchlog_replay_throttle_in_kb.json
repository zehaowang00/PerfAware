            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `batchlog_replay_throttle_in_kb` directly affects the rate at which batch logs are replayed, which can significantly impact system performance. If the throttle is set too low, it could lead to prolonged replay times, causing delays in processing and potentially overwhelming the system with backlogged operations. Conversely, if set too high, it could lead to excessive resource consumption, affecting memory and CPU usage. Given that this configuration can lead to substantial variations in performance due to its influence on the throughput of batch log processing, it is classified as performance sensitive."
