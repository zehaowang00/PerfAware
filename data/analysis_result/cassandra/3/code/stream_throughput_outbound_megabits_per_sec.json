            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` directly influences the rate at which data is streamed, which can significantly affect system performance in scenarios involving high data transfer rates. Adjusting this configuration impacts the `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateThroughput()` method, which is likely responsible for managing the flow of data and can lead to substantial variations in throughput performance. Given that this configuration can lead to time-intensive operations during data transmission, it is classified as performance sensitive."
