            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The garbage collection (GC) process is critical to the performance of Java applications, as it directly impacts memory management and application throughput. The `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` configuration likely influences how GC events are logged and monitored, which can affect the performance of the application during high-load scenarios. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive logging, potentially causing performance degradation due to increased I/O operations and memory usage for log storage. Therefore, this configuration can have substantial system-level performance impacts, qualifying it as performance sensitive."
