            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: The `native_transport_idle_timeout` setting primarily affects how long a connection can remain idle before being closed. While it can influence resource utilization by closing idle connections, it does not involve time-intensive or memory-intensive operations that would cause significant performance variations. The impact of this configuration is more about resource management rather than direct performance degradation or enhancement, thus it does not meet the criteria for being classified as performance-sensitive."
