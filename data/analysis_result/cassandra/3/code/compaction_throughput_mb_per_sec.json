A higher throughput can lead to faster data processing and reduced latency, while a lower throughput may cause increased I/O operations and longer processing times, thus affecting system responsiveness and resource utilization. Given that compaction is a critical operation in maintaining database performance, variations in this configuration can lead to substantial performance differences."
