            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `networking_cache_size_in_mb` directly affects the `NETWORKING_MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD`, which is critical for managing short-lived buffers used in client-server and inter-node requests. If this threshold is set too low, it could lead to frequent memory allocation and deallocation, causing increased latency and resource contention during high-load scenarios. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage, impacting overall system performance. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance due to its influence on memory management and operational efficiency in time-sensitive networking operations."
