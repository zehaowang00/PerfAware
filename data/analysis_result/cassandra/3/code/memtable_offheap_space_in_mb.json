            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `memtable_offheap_space_in_mb` configuration directly influences the allocation of off-heap memory for memtables, which can significantly affect memory usage and garbage collection behavior in the system. This can lead to substantial performance variations, especially in memory-intensive operations where large datasets are involved. The choice of off-heap allocation type (e.g., `offheap_buffers` or `offheap_objects`) can also impact the efficiency of memory management and access patterns, making it critical for overall system performance."
