            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_concurrent_auto_upgrade_tasks` directly influences the number of concurrent upgrade tasks that can be executed. If this value is set too high, it could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O), especially if the upgrade tasks are time-intensive or memory-heavy. Conversely, setting it too low could lead to underutilization of resources and slower performance during upgrades. The balance of this configuration has a substantial impact on system performance during critical operations, making it performance sensitive."
