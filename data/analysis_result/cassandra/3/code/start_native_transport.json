This layer is critical for handling client requests, and its initialization can lead to significant performance variations, especially in scenarios with high data throughput or numerous client connections. If native transport is not started, the system may experience delays or increased resource usage due to fallback mechanisms, making this configuration's impact on system performance substantial."
