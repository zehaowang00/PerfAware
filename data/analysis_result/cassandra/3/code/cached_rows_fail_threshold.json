            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `cached_rows_fail_threshold` directly impacts the performance of the system by influencing how many rows can be cached before a failure occurs. This threshold affects the efficiency of the replica filtering and read-repair processes, which are critical for maintaining data consistency and performance in distributed systems. If set too low, it could lead to excessive read operations and increased latency, while a high threshold could result in memory pressure and potential out-of-memory errors. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance, making it performance sensitive."
