This value is converted to nanoseconds for internal calculations.\n\n2. **Commit Log Sync Period**:\n   - The constructor of `PeriodicCommitLogService` retrieves the commit log synchronization period from `DatabaseDescriptor.getCommitLogSyncPeriod()`. This period determines how often the commit log is synchronized.\n\n3. **Compression and Encryption Configuration**:\n   - The service checks the `commitLog.configuration` to determine if compression or encryption is used. If either is enabled, it adjusts its behavior accordingly by passing a boolean value to the superclass constructor.\n\n### Key Methods:\n- **Constructor**: Initializes the service with the commit log, a name, sync period, and flags for compression and encryption.\n- **maybeWaitForSync**: This method calculates if the service needs to wait for synchronization based on the last sync time and the configured block duration. If the last sync is older than the expected sync time, it increments a pending count, awaits synchronization, and then decrements the count.\n\nThis configuration ensures that the `PeriodicCommitLogService` operates efficiently while managing synchronization based on system performance and configuration settings."
