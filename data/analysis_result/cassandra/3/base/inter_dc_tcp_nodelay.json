The justification highlights how enabling or disabling TCP_NODELAY affects latency and throughput, which are critical factors in data transfer efficiency. The explanation is comprehensive, addressing the potential for significant performance variations in high-volume scenarios, thereby affirming the importance of this configuration in optimizing system performance."
