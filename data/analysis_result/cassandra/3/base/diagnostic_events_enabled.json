This ensures that events are only processed if there are subscribers interested in them.\n\n4. **General Diagnostics Check**:\n   - The method `isDiagnosticsEnabled()` provides a straightforward way to check if diagnostic events are enabled, encapsulating the call to `DatabaseDescriptor.diagnosticEventsEnabled()`.\n\n### Summary of Methods:\n- **publish(DiagnosticEvent event)**: Publishes the event to subscribers if diagnostic events are enabled.\n- **isEnabled(Class<E> event)**: Checks if events are enabled for a specific event class.\n- **isEnabled(Class<E> event, T eventType)**: Checks if events are enabled for a specific event class and type.\n- **isDiagnosticsEnabled()**: Returns the status of diagnostic events enablement.\n\nThis configuration setup ensures that the system only engages in event processing when it is appropriately configured to do so, which can help in managing performance and resource utilization."
