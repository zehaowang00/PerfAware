If not, it registers the current instance of `GCInspector` as an MBean.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - The constructor handles exceptions related to malformed object names and IO issues, throwing a `RuntimeException` if any occur.\n\n### Configuration Context\n- **No Direct Configuration Parameters**: The code does not reference any specific configuration parameters, such as `gc_warn_threshold_in_ms`. It focuses on initializing and managing garbage collection monitoring via JMX.\n\nThis summary provides an overview of the initialization process for garbage collection monitoring but does not include any specific configuration settings related to GC thresholds or parameters.
