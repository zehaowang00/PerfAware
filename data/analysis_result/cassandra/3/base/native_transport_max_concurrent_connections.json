This value is sourced from the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\n\n2. **Connection Limit Enforcement**:\n   - In the `channelActive` method, the current connection count is compared against the maximum allowed connections (`limit`). If the count exceeds this limit, the connection is closed, and an error is logged.\n   - If the limit is set to -1, it effectively disables the connection limit by setting it to `Long.MAX_VALUE`.\n\n3. **Per IP Connection Limit**:\n   - The method checks for a per-IP connection limit (`perIpLimit`). If this limit is greater than 0, it tracks connections per client IP address.\n   - If the per-IP connection count exceeds the specified limit, the connection is closed, and an error is logged.\n\n4. **Pipeline Configuration**:\n   - The `configureInitialPipeline` method adds a `ConnectionLimitHandler` to the pipeline if either the maximum concurrent connections or the per-IP connection limit is greater than 0. This ensures that connection limits are enforced as the first action in the pipeline.\n\n5. **Idle Timeout**:\n   - An idle timeout is configured using `nativeTransportIdleTimeout()`. If the timeout is greater than 0, an `IdleStateHandler` is added to the pipeline to close connections that have been idle for too long.\n\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`: Maximum number of concurrent native connections.\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`: Maximum number of concurrent connections allowed per IP address.\n- `native_transport_idle_timeout`: Timeout duration for idle connections. \n\nThis configuration is crucial for managing resource usage and ensuring fair access to the service across multiple clients."
