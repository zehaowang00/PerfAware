It is accessed through the method `getSnapshotLinksPerSecond()`, which retrieves its value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class. This indicates that the configuration is likely stored in a database or a similar persistent storage mechanism managed by the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n\nKey components involved in this configuration include:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class acts as the source of truth for various configuration values, including `snapshot_links_per_second`. It abstracts the retrieval of configuration data, ensuring that the system can access up-to-date settings.\n- **getSnapshotLinksPerSecond() method**: This method serves as an interface for other parts of the codebase to obtain the current value of the configuration, promoting encapsulation and separation of concerns.\n\nThe interaction of this configuration with other parts of the system is primarily through the `getSnapshotRateLimiter()` method, which utilizes the value obtained from `getSnapshotLinksPerSecond()` to create a `RateLimiter`. This indicates that the configuration is integral to controlling the flow of snapshot link processing, ensuring that the system adheres to the defined limits set in the `DatabaseDescriptor`. Overall, `snapshot_links_per_second` plays a crucial role in managing the operational parameters of the system while maintaining a clear dependency on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for its value."
