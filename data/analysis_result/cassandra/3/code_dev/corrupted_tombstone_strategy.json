If the strategy is set to `disabled`, the validation process is skipped entirely.\n- **Error Handling**: Depending on the strategy set (either `exception` or `warn`), the system will either throw an exception or log a warning when invalid deletions are detected. This allows for flexible handling of data integrity issues based on the operational requirements.\n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n- **`DatabaseDescriptor`**: This component is responsible for retrieving the current configuration setting for the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy`.\n- **`Unfiltered`**: Represents the data structure being validated. It is checked for invalid deletions based on the strategy.\n- **`TableMetadata`**: Provides metadata about the table being processed, which is essential for constructing error messages and understanding the context of the data.\n- **`DecoratedKey`**: Represents the key of the data being validated, which is used in error reporting.\n- **`SSTableReader`**: Represents the SSTable being read, and it is marked as suspect if an invalid deletion is found, preventing it from being included in future operations.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts closely with the data validation logic in the `maybeValidateUnfiltered` method, where it checks for invalid deletions in the unfiltered data.\n- If invalid deletions are found, the `handleInvalid` method is invoked, which utilizes the strategy to determine the appropriate response (throwing an exception or logging a warning).\n- The configuration influences the overall data integrity management strategy by determining how the system reacts to potential data corruption, thereby impacting the reliability of data operations.\n\nIn summary, the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` configuration is essential for ensuring that the system can appropriately handle and respond to data integrity issues related to tombstones, allowing for configurable error management based on operational needs."
