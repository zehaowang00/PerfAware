It serves as the source of configuration values, ensuring that the system can retrieve the necessary settings for SSTable management.\n\n2. **calculateOpenInterval Method**: This method utilizes the configuration value to compute the interval in bytes by multiplying the megabyte value by \\(1L << 20\\) (which converts megabytes to bytes). The method also includes logic to handle specific conditions, such as disabling early opening for tests or when the `shouldOpenEarly` flag is false.\n\n3. **getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB Method**: This method acts as a getter for the `sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb` configuration, allowing other parts of the system to access the current setting directly from the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb` configuration interacts with the data loading mechanisms of the system.

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb` directly influences how SSTables are opened and managed in memory, which can significantly affect data retrieval performance. If the interval is set too low, it may lead to increased memory usage and slower access times due to frequent SSTable openings, while a higher value may delay data availability. This configuration's impact on system-level performance is substantial, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets and high-frequency access patterns, making it critical for performance optimization."
