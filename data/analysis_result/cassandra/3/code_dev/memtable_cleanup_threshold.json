            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `memtable_cleanup_threshold` directly influences when memtables are cleaned up, which can significantly impact memory usage and overall system performance. If the threshold is set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption, causing the system to slow down or even run out of memory. Conversely, if set too low, it may result in frequent cleanups that can degrade performance due to time-intensive flush operations. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for both time and memory efficiency in the system."
