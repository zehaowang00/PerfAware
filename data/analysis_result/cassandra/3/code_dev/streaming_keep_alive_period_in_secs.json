Its primary purpose is to define the interval at which keep-alive tasks are scheduled to ensure that connections between peers remain active and responsive.\n\n### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **Keep-Alive Task Scheduling**: The configuration value is retrieved using `DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingKeepAlivePeriod()`, which determines the frequency of the keep-alive tasks. These tasks are essential for maintaining the connection state between streaming peers, preventing timeouts and disconnections.\n\n2. **Error Logging**: In the `logError` method, if a `SocketTimeoutException` occurs, the system logs a message that suggests increasing the `streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs`. This indicates that the configuration is directly tied to the error handling process, providing guidance on potential adjustments to maintain connection stability.\n\n3. **Dependencies**: The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to fetch the keep-alive period.
