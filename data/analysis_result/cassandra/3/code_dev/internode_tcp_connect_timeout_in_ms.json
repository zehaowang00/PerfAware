This configuration plays a crucial role in ensuring that the system can effectively manage network connectivity and responsiveness between different components.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **Method: `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**\n   - This method checks if a local timeout value (`tcpConnectTimeoutInMS`) is set. If it is not null, it returns this value. Otherwise, it retrieves the timeout value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class using the method `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`.\n   - This conditional logic allows for flexibility, enabling the system to either use a custom-defined timeout or a default value from the configuration.\n\n2. **Method: `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**\n   - This method directly accesses the `DatabaseDescriptor` to obtain the internode TCP connect timeout value. It serves as a straightforward way to fetch the default configuration value used across the system.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: The `DatabaseDescriptor` class is a key component that provides the default configuration values for various settings, including the internode TCP connect timeout. This dependency indicates that the configuration is centralized and can be modified in one place to affect the entire system.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The timeout configuration is likely utilized by network-related components that establish connections between nodes. By having a configurable timeout, the system can adapt to different network conditions and requirements, ensuring that node-to-node communication is handled appropriately.\n\nIn summary, the `internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` configuration is integral to managing TCP connection timeouts within a distributed environment, providing both flexibility and centralized control through the `DatabaseDescriptor`."
