This configuration defines the time interval at which the index summary's memory pool is resized, allowing the system to adapt to changing data requirements.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to manage the resizing of the index summary memory pool efficiently. By setting a specific interval, the system can periodically evaluate and adjust the memory allocation for the index summary, ensuring that it meets the needs of the application without manual intervention.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for providing the configuration values, including the resize interval. It acts as a centralized source for configuration parameters related to the database.\n- **IndexSummaryManager**: This class utilizes the resize interval during its initialization. It retrieves the value from `DatabaseDescriptor` and sets it through the method `setResizeIntervalInMinutes`.\n\n#### Interactions:\nUpon instantiation of the `IndexSummaryManager`, the constructor retrieves the `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes` from `DatabaseDescriptor`. This value is logged for informational purposes and is subsequently used to configure the resizing behavior of the index summary memory pool. This interaction ensures that the index summary manager operates with the correct settings as defined in the system's configuration.\n\nIn summary, the `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes` configuration is integral to the dynamic management of memory resources in the `IndexSummaryManager`, facilitating efficient memory usage based on the application's operational needs."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes` directly influences the frequency at which the index summary's memory pool is resized. If this interval is set too short, it could lead to frequent memory allocations and deallocations, which are time-intensive operations that can degrade system performance. Conversely, if set too long, it may result in insufficient memory allocation, causing performance bottlenecks during peak usage.
