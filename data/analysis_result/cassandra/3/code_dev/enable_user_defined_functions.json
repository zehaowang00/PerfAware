When set to `true`, it allows users to create and execute custom functions, enhancing the database's flexibility and functionality. If it is set to `false`, any attempts to use UDFs will result in an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that UDFs are disabled.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for reading and providing access to various configuration settings defined in the `cassandra.yaml` file, including the `enable_user_defined_functions` flag.\n- **InvalidRequestException**: This exception is thrown when a request is made to use UDFs while they are disabled, ensuring that the system enforces the configuration settings.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `assertUdfsEnabled` method checks the status of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration before allowing the execution of user-defined functions. If UDFs are not enabled, the method raises an exception, preventing further execution and signaling to the user that they need to modify the configuration to enable this feature.\n\nThis configuration interacts closely with the overall functionality of the Cassandra database, as it directly influences the capabilities available to users for extending database operations through custom logic."
