If the timeout is set too low, it could lead to frequent timeouts and retries, causing significant performance degradation, especially under load. Conversely, if set too high, it could lead to resource contention and delayed responses, impacting overall system performance. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance, making it performance sensitive."
