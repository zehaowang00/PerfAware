This allocation can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios with high write throughput, as inadequate memory can lead to increased garbage collection, slower write operations, and potential out-of-memory errors. The choice of allocation type (heap vs. off-heap) further affects memory management efficiency and performance characteristics, making this configuration crucial for maintaining optimal system performance."
