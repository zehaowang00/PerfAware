            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `flush_compression` configuration directly influences the throughput of the compressor during flush operations, which can significantly impact system performance. In scenarios where large tables are flushed, the choice of compression algorithm can lead to substantial variations in write latency and overall system responsiveness. If a slower compressor is used, it can queue flush operations and block writes, leading to performance degradation. Therefore, the configuration's effect on time-intensive operations during data flushing classifies it as performance-sensitive."
