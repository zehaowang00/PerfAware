Its primary function is to provide a configurable value that dictates how much data can be queued for sending between nodes.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The method first checks if the local variable `applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes` is set (not null). If it is, the method returns this value, indicating that a specific configuration has been provided.\n- If the local variable is null, the method falls back to a default value obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()`. This indicates that the system has a predefined capacity setting that can be used when no specific configuration is provided.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The method relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to fetch the default queue capacity. This establishes a dependency on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for obtaining configuration values that are essential for the system's inter-node communication.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\n- The configuration interacts with the broader messaging or communication framework of the system, as it defines limits for how much data can be queued for sending. This is crucial for ensuring that the application can manage its data flow effectively between nodes.\n- By allowing for both a custom configuration and a default fallback, the method provides flexibility in how the application can be set up and adjusted according to specific deployment needs.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a vital role in managing the data transmission capacity between nodes, ensuring that the system can operate efficiently based on either user-defined or default settings."
