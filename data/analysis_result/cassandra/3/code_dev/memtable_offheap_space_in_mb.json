This allows for efficient memory management by separating the storage of memtables from the Java heap, thus reducing garbage collection overhead.\n\n2. **Cleaning Threshold**: The configuration also interacts with the `cleaningThreshold`, which is obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableCleanupThreshold()`. This threshold is used to determine when the memtable should be cleaned or flushed, ensuring that memory usage remains within acceptable limits.\n\n3. **Memtable Pool Creation**: The method `createMemtableAllocatorPool()` utilizes the `offHeapLimit` in conjunction with the memtable allocation type specified in the system configuration.
