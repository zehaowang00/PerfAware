The choice of cache provider can lead to substantial variations in how data is stored, retrieved, and managed, potentially resulting in time-intensive operations if a less efficient provider is selected. Additionally, the size of the row cache (in MB) and the number of keys to save can lead to memory-intensive operations, especially if the cache is configured to hold a large amount of data. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance."
