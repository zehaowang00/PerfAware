It ensures that streaming is only performed when it is explicitly allowed by the configuration and when certain data integrity conditions are met.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing the configuration value for `stream_entire_sstables`. It acts as a central point for retrieving various system configurations.\n2. **SSTableMetadata**: This component is accessed through the `ref.get().getSSTableMetadata()` method and contains metadata about the SSTable, including whether it has legacy counter shards.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The decision to stream SSTables is dependent on the value returned by `DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables()`. If this value is `false`, the system will not stream the SSTables.\n- Additionally, the presence of legacy counter shards in the SSTable metadata (`hasLegacyCounterShards`) is another critical condition that, if true, will prevent streaming.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables` method interacts with the broader data streaming process by evaluating the conditions under which SSTables can be streamed. If the conditions are not met (i.e., if streaming is disabled or legacy counter shards are present), the method returns `false`, effectively halting the streaming process. If both conditions are satisfied, it proceeds to check if the specific sections of data should be streamed, utilizing the `contained(sections, ref.get())` method.\n\nOverall, this configuration serves as a gatekeeper for SSTable streaming, ensuring that only valid and appropriate data transfers occur within the system."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `stream_entire_sstables` configuration directly influences whether entire SSTables are streamed during data transfer operations. If enabled, streaming entire SSTables can lead to significant memory and time consumption, especially when dealing with large datasets. This can result in performance variations that are substantial, as the transfer of large volumes of data can be both time-intensive and memory-intensive. Conversely, if disabled, it prevents potentially heavy operations, thus impacting overall system performance. Therefore, this configuration is critical for maintaining optimal performance in data streaming scenarios."
