It defines the desired level of consistency for write operations across replicas, influencing how responses are managed based on the specified consistency requirements.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the ideal consistency level is to provide a mechanism to track and manage the consistency level that is deemed optimal for write operations. This configuration allows the system to adaptively handle different consistency requirements based on the context of the write operation, ensuring that the responses are tailored to meet the specified consistency criteria.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **AbstractWriteResponseHandler**: This is the base class for handling write responses. The specific implementation used (e.g., `DatacenterWriteResponseHandler`, `DatacenterSyncWriteResponseHandler`, or `WriteResponseHandler`) depends on the consistency level of the write operation and the architecture of the system (e.g., network topology).\n   \n2. **ReplicaPlan.ForTokenWrite**: This component represents the plan for writing data to replicas, including the consistency level that dictates how many replicas must acknowledge the write before it is considered successful.\n\n3. **ConsistencyLevel**: This enumeration defines various levels of consistency (e.g., ONE, QUORUM, ALL) that can be set and tracked. The ideal consistency level can be set or retrieved using the `setIdealConsistencyLevel` and `getIdealConsistencyLevel` methods.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System\n- The `getWriteResponseHandler` method utilizes the ideal consistency level to determine how to construct the appropriate response handler based on the current replica plan's consistency level. If the ideal consistency level matches the requested level, the response handler is set to track this ideal state.\n  \n- If there is a discrepancy between the ideal and requested consistency levels, a delegate response handler is created to monitor the ideal consistency level while processing the write operation. This allows for a clear distinction between the actual consistency level used for the operation and the ideal level that the system aims to achieve.\n\n- The configuration interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor`, which serves as a central point for managing system-wide configurations, including the ideal consistency level.\n\nIn summary, the ideal consistency level configuration is integral to ensuring that write operations are conducted in a manner that aligns with the desired consistency requirements, facilitating effective data management in a distributed environment."
