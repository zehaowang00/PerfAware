            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `commitlog_sync` configuration directly influences the choice of commit log service, which can have substantial impacts on system performance. Each service (periodic, batch, group) has different operational characteristics that can lead to significant variations in performance, particularly in scenarios with high write loads or large volumes of commit logs. For example, a batch service may optimize for throughput at the cost of latency, while a periodic service may introduce delays in log availability. Therefore, the choice of synchronization strategy can lead to extremely time-consuming operations, making this configuration critical for overall system performance."
