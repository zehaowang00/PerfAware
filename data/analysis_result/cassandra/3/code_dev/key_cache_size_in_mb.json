A larger cache size can significantly improve performance by reducing the frequency of time-consuming disk accesses, while a smaller cache may lead to increased cache misses and slower performance. Since the cache size influences both memory usage and the speed of data access, it can lead to substantial performance variations in the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
