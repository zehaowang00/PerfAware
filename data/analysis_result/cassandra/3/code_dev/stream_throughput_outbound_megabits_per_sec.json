It provides methods to get the current throughput value and to set a new value.\n\n2. **StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter**: This component is responsible for enforcing the throughput limits set by the configuration. When the throughput value is updated, the `updateThroughput()` method is called to adjust the rate limiting accordingly.\n\n3. **Logger**: The logging mechanism captures changes to the throughput setting, providing a record of the previous and current values for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `setStreamThroughputMbPerSec(int value)` method allows for dynamic updates to the outbound stream throughput. It retrieves the current value, updates it with the new value, and then notifies the `StreamRateLimiter` to apply the new settings.\n  \n- The `getStreamThroughputMbPerSec()` method provides a way for other components to access the current throughput value, ensuring that any part of the system that relies on this configuration can retrieve the latest settings.\n\n- The `calculateRateInBytes()` method uses the throughput value to compute the equivalent rate in bytes. This method is crucial for determining how data transfer should be managed based on the configured throughput, particularly in scenarios where the throughput is set to zero or a negative value, indicating that throttling is disabled.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a critical role in controlling data flow within the system, ensuring that outbound streams adhere to specified limits while interacting closely with the `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StreamManager` components."

Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in performance, especially in high-throughput scenarios where the system must manage large volumes of data. The interaction with `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter` indicates that this configuration is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and preventing bottlenecks. If set incorrectly, it could lead to either underutilization of available bandwidth or overwhelming the system's capacity, both of which can have severe performance implications."
