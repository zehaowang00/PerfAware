It is utilized in the initialization of the `PipelineConfigurator`, which is responsible for setting up the communication pipeline for the server.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Builder Class**: The `Server` constructor accepts a `Builder` object that encapsulates various configuration parameters, including `tlsEncryptionPolicy` and `workerGroup`. The builder pattern allows for flexible and readable configuration of the server instance.\n\n2. **PipelineConfigurator**: This component is initialized based on the presence of a custom `pipelineConfigurator` in the builder. If none is provided, a new instance is created, incorporating `rpc_keepalive` as one of its parameters. This indicates that the keepalive setting is essential for maintaining active connections and ensuring they remain responsive.\n\n3. **DatabaseDescriptor**: The `rpc_keepalive` value is retrieved from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, suggesting that it is a centralized configuration source for database-related settings. This dependency indicates that the keepalive configuration is likely tied to the database's operational parameters.\n\n4. **Worker Group**: The server can utilize either `EpollEventLoopGroup` or `NioEventLoopGroup` based on the `useEpoll` flag. This choice affects how the server handles concurrent connections, but the `rpc_keepalive` setting is independent of this choice, focusing instead on connection longevity.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `rpc_keepalive` configuration interacts primarily with the `PipelineConfigurator`, influencing how the server manages its connections. By ensuring that idle connections are kept alive, it helps maintain the stability of RPC communications. This configuration is essential for systems that require persistent connections, as it mitigates the risk of connection drops due to inactivity.\n\nOverall, the `rpc_keepalive` setting is a fundamental aspect of the server's configuration, ensuring robust and reliable communication within the system's architecture."
