The interaction with `DatabaseDescriptor` indicates a dependency on the database's configuration management, suggesting that the CDC space is defined at the database level.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a crucial role in determining how much data can be captured for change tracking, thereby influencing data management and replication processes within the system. It serves as a foundational element for any features or functionalities that rely on CDC, ensuring that there is a defined limit on the amount of data that can be captured and stored."
