A higher number of delivery threads can significantly enhance the throughput of hint delivery operations, especially in scenarios with high workloads. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks, resulting in delays and inefficient resource utilization. Given that hint delivery is a critical operation that can impact overall system performance, this configuration can lead to substantial variations in performance based on its value, classifying it as performance sensitive."
