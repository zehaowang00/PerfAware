It serves as a critical parameter that defines the maximum allowable data transfer rate in megabits per second.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\n- **Setting Throughput**: The method `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec(int value)` allows for updating the outbound throughput value. It retrieves the current setting, updates it with the new value, and subsequently invokes `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateInterDCThroughput()` to apply the changes. This ensures that the system adheres to the newly defined throughput limit.\n- **Getting Throughput**: The method `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec()` provides a way to retrieve the current outbound throughput setting, facilitating access to this configuration for other components or services within the system.\n- **Calculating Rate**: The private method `calculateInterDCRateInBytes()` computes the equivalent throughput in bytes based on the current megabits per second setting. It returns a maximum double value if the throughput is set to zero or a negative value, indicating that throttling is effectively disabled.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is central to the configuration, as it provides static methods to get and set the throughput value. It acts as a storage point for the configuration data.\n- **StreamManager**: The `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter` is directly involved in enforcing the throughput limits. When the throughput is updated, this component is notified to adjust its rate-limiting mechanisms accordingly.\n- **Logging**: The configuration updates are logged for tracking purposes, which aids in monitoring changes to the throughput settings.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a vital role in controlling data flow between data centers, ensuring that the system can manage its inter-data center communication effectively. Its interactions with `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StreamManager` highlight its integration within the broader architecture, enabling dynamic adjustments to data transfer rates as needed."
