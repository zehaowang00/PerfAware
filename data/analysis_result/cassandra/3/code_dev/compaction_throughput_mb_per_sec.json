This ensures that the compaction process adheres to the defined throughput limit.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for retrieving the configuration value for `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec`. The method `getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec()` is called to obtain the current setting, which is then used to configure the rate limiter.\n\nThe interaction between these components ensures that the system can effectively manage the rate of data compaction, allowing for controlled resource utilization during this process.
