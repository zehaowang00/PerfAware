It defines the duration of inactivity (in milliseconds) after which an idle client connection will be automatically closed. This timeout is retrieved from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which centralizes configuration settings for the database.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **ChannelPipeline**: The configuration is applied to the `ChannelPipeline`, which is a series of handlers that process inbound and outbound events for a channel. The pipeline is essential for managing the flow of data and events in the system.\n- **IdleStateHandler**: This handler is added to the pipeline if the `idleTimeout` value is greater than zero. It monitors the state of the channel and triggers specific actions when the channel is idle for the configured duration.\n- **ChannelHandlerContext**: Within the `IdleStateHandler`, the `channelIdle` method is overridden to define the behavior when a channel becomes idle. It logs the closure of the client connection and then closes the channel.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `configureInitialPipeline` method is responsible for setting up the initial state of the channel's pipeline. By incorporating the idle timeout configuration, it ensures that inactive connections do not remain open indefinitely, which could lead to resource exhaustion. This mechanism interacts with other handlers in the pipeline, such as connection management and error handling, to maintain the overall stability and reliability of the system.\n\nIn summary, the `native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms` configuration is crucial for managing idle connections, contributing to the system's robustness by ensuring that inactive client connections are closed in a timely manner."
