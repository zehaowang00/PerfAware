This configuration is accessed through the method `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()`, which retrieves its value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to set a limit on the size of data batches processed by the system, ensuring that operations do not exceed a predefined size that could lead to failures during processing.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **`DatabaseDescriptor` Class**: This class is responsible for managing various database-related configurations, including the batch size failure threshold. The method `getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB()` is a static method that returns the threshold value.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()` method serves as an interface for other components in the system to access the batch size failure threshold. It allows different parts of the application to check this configuration before executing batch operations, ensuring that they adhere to the defined limits.\n- This configuration may interact with data processing modules that handle batch operations, providing them with the necessary constraints to manage data effectively.\n\nOverall, the `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb` configuration plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of batch processing within the system by providing a defined limit that can be referenced by various components."

The retrieval of this configuration value is a lightweight operation, and the threshold itself is a guideline rather than a mechanism that would cause significant performance variations.
