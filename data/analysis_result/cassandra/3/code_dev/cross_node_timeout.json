This is significant in scenarios where consistency and synchronization across nodes are necessary.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `getExpiresAtNanos` computes the expiration time in nanoseconds by taking three parameters: `createdAtNanos`, `currentTimeNanos`, and `expirationPeriodNanos`.\n- It first checks if the `cross_node_timeout` feature is enabled by calling `DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout()`.

This indicates that the configuration is dependent on the overall database settings and its ability to handle cross-node operations.\n- The expiration logic interacts with other components that manage time-sensitive operations, ensuring that entities do not remain valid beyond their intended lifespan, especially in a distributed context.\n\nIn summary, the `cross_node_timeout` configuration is integral to managing how expiration times are calculated in a distributed system, ensuring that operations are appropriately timed based on their creation and the current system state."
