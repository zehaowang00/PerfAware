It retrieves configuration values such as heap and off-heap memory limits, as well as a cleaning threshold, from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class. These values dictate how much memory can be utilized for memtables and how they will be cleaned up.\n\n### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the source of configuration values, providing methods to obtain memory limits and the cleaning threshold.\n2. **MemtablePool**: An abstract representation of the pool from which memtables will be allocated.
