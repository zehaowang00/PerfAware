            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Summary of Configuration: `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`\n\nThe `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip` configuration parameter plays a critical role in managing connection limits for native transport in the system. Its primary purpose is to restrict the number of concurrent connections that can be established from a single IP address, thereby controlling resource usage and enhancing security.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor Dependency**: The configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which retrieves the value defined in the system's configuration file (e.g., `cassandra.yaml`). This ensures that the application adheres to the specified limits set by the system administrator.\n\n2. **Connection Handling**: The `channelActive` method is responsible for managing new incoming connections. It checks the total number of active connections against the overall limit (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`) and the per-IP limit (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`).\n\n3. **Connection Counting**: \n   - Each time a new connection is established, a counter is incremented. If the total count exceeds the configured limit, the connection is closed, and an error is logged.\n   - For per-IP limits, the system retrieves the client's IP address and maintains a count of connections from that address. If the count exceeds the per-IP limit, the connection is also closed, and an error is logged.\n\n4. **Pipeline Configuration**: In the `configureInitialPipeline` method, the `ConnectionLimitHandler` is added to the channel's pipeline if either the total or per-IP connection limits are greater than zero. This ensures that connection limits are enforced as soon as a connection is established.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts closely with the connection management logic, ensuring that limits are enforced at the point of connection establishment.\n- It also relies on the `ChannelPipeline` to integrate the connection limit handler, which processes incoming connections according to the defined limits.\n- The logging mechanism is utilized to provide feedback when limits are exceeded, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\nIn summary, the `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip` configuration is essential for controlling the number of concurrent connections from individual IP addresses, thereby supporting the overall stability and security of the system's networking capabilities."
