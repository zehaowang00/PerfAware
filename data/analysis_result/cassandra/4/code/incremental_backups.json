The operations performed within the loop (getting the backup directory and creating links) are not inherently time-intensive or memory-heavy, as they depend on the number of SSTableReader instances. Unless the number of SSTableReaders is extremely large, these operations are unlikely to cause significant performance variations. Therefore, this configuration does not directly lead to substantial system-level performance impacts."
