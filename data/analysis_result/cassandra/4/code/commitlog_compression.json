Compression algorithms can be time-intensive, especially during write and read operations, which may lead to increased latency if not optimized. Additionally, the choice of compression can affect memory usage during these operations, as different algorithms have varying memory footprints. Therefore, this configuration directly influences the performance characteristics of the commit log system, making it critical for overall system efficiency."
