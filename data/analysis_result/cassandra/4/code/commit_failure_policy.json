            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `commit_failure_policy` directly influences how the system responds to commit log errors, which can lead to significant performance impacts. Specifically, the policies `die`, `stop`, and `stop_commit` can cause the system to halt operations and terminate threads, potentially leading to prolonged downtime or resource wastage. The handling of these policies involves critical operations like stopping transports and killing the JVM, which are time-intensive and can severely affect system performance during error scenarios. In contrast, the `ignore` policy, while less impactful, still requires logging which could add overhead, but the primary concern lies with the more severe policies that can halt system functionality."
