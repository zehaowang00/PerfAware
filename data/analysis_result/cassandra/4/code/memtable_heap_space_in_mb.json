            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `memtable_heap_space_in_mb` setting directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are critical for database write operations. A higher memory allocation can lead to improved write performance by reducing the frequency of flushes to disk, while insufficient memory can cause increased garbage collection and latency, significantly impacting overall system performance. Given that this configuration can lead to substantial variations in memory usage and operational efficiency, it is classified as performance sensitive."
