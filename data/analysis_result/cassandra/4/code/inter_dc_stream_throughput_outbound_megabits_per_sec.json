The throughput value itself does not directly lead to significant performance variations; rather, it influences the rate limiting of streams, which is a mechanism that may have some impact but does not constitute a substantial performance concern in terms of time or memory usage. The calculations performed are straightforward multiplications and condition checks, which are not performance-sensitive operations."
