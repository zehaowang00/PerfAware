            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The choice of commit log synchronization method (periodic, batch, or group) directly impacts the performance of the system by determining how and when commit logs are processed. Each method can lead to significant variations in performance, particularly in scenarios with high write loads or large data volumes, as they dictate the frequency and manner of log flushing to disk. This can result in time-intensive operations that affect overall system throughput and latency, making it critical to consider the synchronization strategy for optimal performance."
