Since it affects how data is transmitted, any changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications where data transfer rates are critical. The method `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateThroughput()` suggests that the system actively manages and adjusts the streaming rate based on this configuration, indicating that improper settings could lead to bottlenecks or underutilization of resources, thus impacting overall system performance."
