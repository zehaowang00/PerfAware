If this capacity is set incorrectly, it can lead to significant delays or memory pressure, resulting in performance degradation during high-load scenarios. The retrieval of this configuration from `DatabaseDescriptor` indicates that it may involve time-intensive operations, especially if it requires database access or complex calculations, further emphasizing its potential impact on system performance."
