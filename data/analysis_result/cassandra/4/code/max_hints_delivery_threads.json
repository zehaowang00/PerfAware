            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_hints_delivery_threads` directly influences the number of concurrent delivery threads for hints, which can significantly impact the system's performance during high-load scenarios. A higher number of delivery threads can lead to increased throughput and reduced latency in hint processing, while a lower number can bottleneck the system, causing delays in hint delivery. This configuration can lead to substantial variations in performance, especially in time-intensive operations related to hint processing and delivery, making it critical for overall system performance."
