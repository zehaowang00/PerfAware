            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `maxHintsFileSize` directly influences the amount of data being processed in the `flushInternal` method. If this size is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage during the session's append operations, potentially causing significant delays and increased resource consumption. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent interruptions in processing, impacting overall throughput. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system performance due to its effect on memory management and processing efficiency."
