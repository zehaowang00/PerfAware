A larger memory pool can lead to increased memory usage, which may affect overall system performance, especially if the system is memory-constrained. Additionally, the resizing interval can impact how frequently the memory pool is adjusted, potentially leading to performance variations during high-load scenarios. Therefore, both configurations can significantly affect system-level performance through memory-intensive operations."
