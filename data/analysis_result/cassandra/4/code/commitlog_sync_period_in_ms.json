If the synchronization period is set too low, it may lead to excessive I/O operations, causing latency and resource contention. Conversely, if set too high, it may delay data persistence, risking data loss during failures. The performance implications of this configuration are substantial due to its potential to affect both throughput and responsiveness of the system."
