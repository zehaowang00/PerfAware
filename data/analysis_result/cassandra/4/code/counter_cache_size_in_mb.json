            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The size of the counter cache directly influences memory usage, as it determines the capacity allocated for caching operations. A larger cache can significantly improve performance by reducing the need for frequent data retrieval from slower storage, while a smaller cache may lead to increased cache misses and thus more time-consuming operations. Given that the cache size is a critical factor in the overall performance of the system, especially in high-load scenarios, it qualifies as performance-sensitive due to its substantial impact on memory and potential latency in data access."
