            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_concurrent_auto_upgrade_tasks` setting directly influences the number of concurrent upgrade tasks that can be executed, which can lead to significant performance variations in the system. If too many tasks are allowed to run simultaneously, it may lead to resource contention, increased memory usage, and potential degradation of overall system performance. Conversely, if the limit is set too low, it may underutilize system resources, leading to longer upgrade times. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its direct correlation with time-intensive operations during the upgrade process."
