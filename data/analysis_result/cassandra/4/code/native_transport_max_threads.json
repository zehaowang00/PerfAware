            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `native_transport_max_threads` configuration directly influences the maximum number of threads that can handle incoming requests in the `requestExecutor`. A higher number of threads can lead to increased parallelism, which is critical for performance in a high-throughput system. Conversely, setting this value too low can create bottlenecks, leading to increased latency and reduced system responsiveness. Therefore, variations in this configuration can result in significant performance impacts due to the time-intensive nature of request processing and resource management in a concurrent environment."
