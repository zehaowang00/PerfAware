It checks if a local variable is null and, if so, calls a method to get a value from `DatabaseDescriptor`. This operation does not involve any time-intensive or memory-intensive processes that would significantly impact system performance. The retrieval of a configuration value does not constitute a performance-sensitive operation, as it does not lead to substantial variations in performance."
