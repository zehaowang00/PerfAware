            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs` directly influences the frequency of keep-alive tasks scheduled in the system. A shorter keep-alive period can lead to increased task scheduling and potentially higher CPU usage, while a longer period may delay necessary checks on peer connectivity, impacting overall system responsiveness. Given that this configuration affects the timing of operations that can be critical in a streaming context, it can lead to significant performance variations, making it performance sensitive."
