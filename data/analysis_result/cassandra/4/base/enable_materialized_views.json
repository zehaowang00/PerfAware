Here are the key configuration-related points extracted from the code:\n\n1. **Materialized Views Enablement**:\n   - The method checks if materialized views are enabled in the Cassandra configuration (`cassandra.yaml`) using `DatabaseDescriptor.getEnableMaterializedViews()`. If not enabled, an exception is thrown.\n\n2. **Keyspace and Table Validation**:\n   - The method retrieves the keyspace and validates its existence. If the keyspace does not exist, an exception is thrown.\n   - It checks if the keyspace has transient replicas, which are not supported for materialized views.\n   - The base table for the materialized view is validated to ensure it exists and is not a counter or another materialized view.\n\n3. **Replication Strategy**:\n   - The method validates the replication strategy of the keyspace to ensure it does not have transient replicas, which would invalidate the creation of a materialized view.\n\n4. **Garbage Collection Grace Seconds**:\n   - The method checks the `gcGraceSeconds` parameter of the base table. If it is set to 0, an exception is thrown, as this could lead to undelivered updates expiring prematurely.\n\n5. **WITH Parameters Validation**:\n   - The method validates the attributes associated with the materialized view. Specifically, it checks if the `DEFAULT_TIME_TO_LIVE` option is set, which is not allowed for materialized views since they inherit the expiration time from the base table.\n\n6. **Table Metadata Building**:\n   - The method constructs a `TableMetadata.Builder` for the new materialized view, setting its parameters and defining the primary key and clustering columns based on the base table's schema.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis method enforces strict validation rules for creating materialized views in Cassandra, ensuring that the configuration aligns with the requirements for materialized views, including replication strategies, table properties, and attribute validations."

Here are the key configuration-related points extracted from the code:\\n\\n1. **Materialized Views Enablement**:\\n   - The method checks if materialized views are enabled in the Cassandra configuration (`cassandra.yaml`) using `DatabaseDescriptor.getEnableMaterializedViews()`. If not enabled, an exception is thrown.\\n\\n2. **Keyspace and Table Validation**:\\n   - The method retrieves the keyspace and validates its existence. If the keyspace does not exist, an exception is thrown.\\n   - It checks if the keyspace has transient replicas, which are not supported for materialized views.\\n   - The base table for the materialized view is validated to ensure it exists and is not a counter or another materialized view.\\n\\n3. **Replication Strategy**:\\n   - The method validates the replication strategy of the keyspace to ensure it does not have transient replicas, which would invalidate the creation of a materialized view.\\n\\n4. **Garbage Collection Grace Seconds**:\\n   - The method checks the `gcGraceSeconds` parameter of the base table. If it is set to 0, an exception is thrown, as this could lead to undelivered updates expiring prematurely.\\n\\n5. **WITH Parameters Validation**:\\n   - The method validates the attributes associated with the materialized view. Specifically, it checks if the `DEFAULT_TIME_TO_LIVE` option is set, which is not allowed for materialized views since they inherit the expiration time from the base table.\\n\\n6. **Table Metadata Building**:\\n   - The method constructs a `TableMetadata.Builder` for the new materialized view, setting its parameters and defining the primary key and clustering columns based on the base table's schema.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis method enforces strict validation rules for creating materialized views in Cassandra, ensuring that the configuration aligns with the requirements for materialized views, including replication strategies, table properties, and attribute validations.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
