            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Configuration Purpose and Interactions Summary\n\n**Configuration Name:** `slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms`\n\n**Purpose:**\nThe `slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms` configuration is designed to define the threshold time for logging slow queries within the system. It serves as a critical parameter for identifying and monitoring queries that exceed a specified execution time, allowing for better visibility into query performance and potential issues.\n\n**Functionality within the System:**\n1. **Integration with Read Commands:**\n   - The configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor.getSlowQueryTimeout(NANOSECONDS)` method, which retrieves the timeout value in nanoseconds. This value is then utilized in methods such as `doVerb` and `runMayThrow` to set monitoring times for read commands. It helps determine if a read operation is considered slow based on its execution duration.\n\n2. **Interaction with Monitoring Components:**\n   - The timeout value influences how the system tracks and logs query performance. When a read command exceeds this timeout, it may trigger logging mechanisms that record the event for further analysis.\n\n3. **Dependencies:**\n   - The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which acts as a centralized configuration management component.
