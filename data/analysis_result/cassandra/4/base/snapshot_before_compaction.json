Here are the key configuration-related aspects:\\n\\n1. **Compaction Strategy Management**:\\n   - The method retrieves the current compaction strategy using `CompactionStrategyManager strategy = cfs.getCompactionStrategyManager();`. This indicates that the compaction behavior can vary based on the strategy configured for the column family store (CFS).\\n\\n2. **Snapshot Before Compaction**:\\n   - The method checks if snapshots should be taken before compaction with `if (DatabaseDescriptor.isSnapshotBeforeCompaction())`. If true, it creates a snapshot of the current state of the CFS using `cfs.snapshotWithoutFlush(...)`. This is a critical configuration option that ensures data safety during the compaction process.\\n\\n3. **Transaction Handling**:\\n   - The method asserts that the transaction is not null and checks if the originals are empty. This indicates that the transaction's state and the data being compacted are crucial for the operation's success.\\n\\n4. **Compaction Controller**:\\n   - The method utilizes a `CompactionController`, which is responsible for managing the compaction process, ensuring that the correct SSTables (Sorted String Tables) are compacted based on the current configuration.\\n\\nThese elements highlight how the configuration of the compaction strategy and snapshot settings influence the behavior of the compaction process in the system.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.

Additionally, empirical data or metrics demonstrating the impact of TTL management on system responsiveness and throughput would strengthen the justification.
