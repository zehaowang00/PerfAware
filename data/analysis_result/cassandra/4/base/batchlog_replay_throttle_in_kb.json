This can be configured in the `cassandra.yaml` file by setting the value to `0`.\n\n2. **Rate Limiting**:\n   - In the `replayFailedBatches()` method, the rate limit is set using the value obtained from `getBatchlogReplayThrottleInKB()`. This controls the maximum amount of data that can be processed per second during the replay of failed batches.\n\n3. **Cluster Endpoint Count**:\n   - The method checks the number of endpoints in the cluster using `StorageService.instance.getTokenMetadata().getSizeOfAllEndpoints()`.
