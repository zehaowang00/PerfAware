It ensures:\n     - Unsafe changes are not allowed unless explicitly permitted.\n     - Transient replication is not supported with virtual nodes (vnodes).\n     - Keyspaces with materialized views or secondary indexes cannot use transient replication.\n     - Full replicas cannot be added if transient replicas exist.\n     - The transient replication factor can only be increased by one at a time.\n\n2. **Bootstrap Token Generation**:\n   - The method `getBootstrapTokens` generates tokens for bootstrapping a node. It considers:\n     - User-specified tokens override automatic allocation.\n     - Ensures the number of tokens is valid (must be >= 1).\n     - Allocates tokens based on the specified keyspace or local replication factor.\n     - Warns if only one token is specified, suggesting more vnodes.\n\n3. **Replication Factor Validation**:\n   - The method `validateReplicationFactor` checks if a given replication factor string is valid. It ensures:\n     - Transient replicas are not allowed with vnodes.\n     - Throws a configuration exception for invalid replication factors.\n\n4. **General Validation**:\n   - The static method `validate` checks:\n     - Transient replication must be enabled if transient replicas are present.\n     - The total replication factor must be non-negative.\n     - Transient replicas must be less than the total replication factor.\n     - Transient nodes are not allowed with multiple tokens.\n\n### Key Configuration Constraints:\n- Transient replication is incompatible with vnodes and certain keyspace features (materialized views, secondary indexes).\n- Changes to replication factors must follow strict rules to maintain data integrity.\n- Token management during bootstrapping is crucial for cluster stability and performance."
