This threshold is used to determine the confidence level in failure detection for nodes in the system.\n\n2. **Conviction Logic**:\n   - The `convict(InetAddressAndPort endpoint, double phi)` method checks if the `phi` value (a measure of the likelihood of a node's failure) is less than twice the Phi Convict Threshold. If it is, the method returns early, indicating that the node should not be convicted.\n   - If the node is convicted (i.e., `phi` is above the threshold), an error is logged, and a force shutdown is initiated for the endpoint.\n\n3. **Handling Coordinator Failures**:\n   - A second `convict(InetAddressAndPort ep, double phi)` method is designed to handle cases where a remote node is a coordinator. It also checks if the `phi` value is below twice the threshold and whether there are any parent repair sessions. If the conditions are met, it calls the `abort` method to remove the coordinator from the parent repair sessions.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The Phi Convict Threshold is crucial for determining when to consider a node as failed.\n- The logic ensures that failure detection is conservative to avoid unnecessary repairs, which can be costly.\n- The system maintains a record of failed coordinators for 24 hours to ensure consistency in repair sessions."
