Different consistency levels can lead to varying latencies and resource utilization, particularly in distributed systems where write operations may involve multiple nodes. The choice of consistency level can cause substantial performance variations due to the time-intensive nature of ensuring data consistency across replicas, especially under high load or with large datasets. Thus, it is crucial to analyze how changes in the ideal consistency level impact overall system performance metrics such as latency and throughput."
