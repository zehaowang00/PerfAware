This path is used to initialize the `CDCSizeTracker`.\n\n2. **CDC Disk Check Interval**:\n   - The `RateLimiter` for size recalculation is set based on `DatabaseDescriptor.getCDCDiskCheckInterval()`, which defines how frequently the disk space is checked for CDC logs.\n\n3. **CDC Space Limit**:\n   - The allowable space for CDC logs is calculated using `DatabaseDescriptor.getCDCSpaceInMB()`, converting megabytes to bytes for comparison against the total size of CDC data on disk.\n\n4. **Commit Log Segment Size**:\n   - The default size for commit log segments is retrieved from `DatabaseDescriptor.getCommitLogSegmentSize()`, which is used to determine if a segment can accept new CDC mutations.\n\n5. **Thread Pool for Size Calculation**:\n   - A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created with a single thread for managing the size calculation of CDC logs, which helps in avoiding long delays during segment allocation.\n\n### Key Methods Related to Configuration:\n- **Constructor**: Initializes `CDCSizeTracker` with the CDC log location.\n- **`start()`**: Initializes the size tracker and starts the management thread.\n- **`shutdown()`**: Shuts down the size calculation executor.\n- **`throwIfForbidden()`**: Checks if a mutation can be accepted based on the current state of the segment and logs a warning if it is forbidden.\n- **`processNewSegment()`**: Updates the state of a new segment based on the current size and allowable bytes.\n\nThis configuration is crucial for managing the disk usage of CDC logs and ensuring that the system operates within defined limits for performance and reliability."
