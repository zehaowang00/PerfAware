It checks the total number of connections against the configured limit (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`). If the limit is exceeded, it logs an error and closes the connection. Additionally, it checks for per-IP connection limits (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`) and enforces these limits by tracking connections per client IP.\n\n3. **Pipeline Configuration**:\n   - **Method**: `configureInitialPipeline(Channel channel, Connection.Factory connectionFactory)`\n   - **Description**: Configures the initial pipeline for handling connections. It adds a `ConnectionLimitHandler` if either the total connection limit or the per-IP limit is greater than zero. This ensures that connection limits are enforced as the first action in the pipeline.\n\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`: Maximum total concurrent connections allowed.\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`: Maximum concurrent connections allowed per individual IP address.\n- `native_transport_idle_timeout`: Configures the idle timeout for connections (not detailed in the provided code but mentioned in the pipeline configuration).\n\nThese configurations are critical for managing connection limits and ensuring the stability of the system under load."

It checks the total number of connections against the configured limit (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`). If the limit is exceeded, it logs an error and closes the connection. Additionally, it checks for per-IP connection limits (`native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`) and enforces these limits by tracking connections per client IP.\\n\\n3. **Pipeline Configuration**:\\n   - **Method**: `configureInitialPipeline(Channel channel, Connection.Factory connectionFactory)`\\n   - **Description**: Configures the initial pipeline for handling connections. It adds a `ConnectionLimitHandler` if either the total connection limit or the per-IP limit is greater than zero. This ensures that connection limits are enforced as the first action in the pipeline.\\n\\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections`: Maximum total concurrent connections allowed.\\n- `native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip`: Maximum concurrent connections allowed per individual IP address.\\n- `native_transport_idle_timeout`: Configures the idle timeout for connections (not detailed in the provided code but mentioned in the pipeline configuration).\\n\\nThese configurations are critical for managing connection limits and ensuring the stability of the system under load.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
