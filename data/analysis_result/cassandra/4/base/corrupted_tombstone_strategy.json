            "content": "analysis_complete: The analysis correctly concludes that the `cross_node_timeout` configuration is Performance Insensitive. The operations involved in determining expiration times are simple boolean checks and arithmetic calculations, which are not resource-intensive. These operations do not significantly affect system performance, as they do not involve complex computations or substantial resource consumption. Therefore, the classification as performance-insensitive is justified and aligns with the criteria for evaluating performance sensitivity."
