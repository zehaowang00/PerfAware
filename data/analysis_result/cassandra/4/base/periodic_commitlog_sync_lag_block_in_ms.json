This value is converted to nanoseconds for internal calculations.\n\n2. **Commit Log Sync Period**:\n   - The constructor of `PeriodicCommitLogService` initializes the sync period using `DatabaseDescriptor.getCommitLogSyncPeriod()`. This value dictates how frequently the commit log should be synchronized.\n\n3. **Compression and Encryption**:\n   - The constructor checks the `commitLog.configuration` to determine if compression or encryption is enabled. If either is enabled, the service will adjust its behavior accordingly by passing a boolean value to the superclass constructor.\n\n### Method Behavior:\n- The `maybeWaitForSync` method calculates the expected synchronization time and checks if the last sync occurred before this expected time. If it has, the method increments a pending count, waits for the sync to complete, and then decrements the pending count. This mechanism helps manage synchronization delays effectively.\n\nThis configuration context provides insights into how the `PeriodicCommitLogService` manages commit log synchronization and handles potential delays."
