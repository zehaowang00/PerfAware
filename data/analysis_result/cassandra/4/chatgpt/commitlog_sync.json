    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. If set to a more aggressive sync policy (e.g., 'batch' or 'periodic'), it can significantly reduce the risk of data loss but may increase latency and I/O operations, affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a less frequent sync (e.g., 'none') can improve write performance but at the risk of losing data in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
