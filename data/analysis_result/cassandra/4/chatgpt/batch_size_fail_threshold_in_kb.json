    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum size of a batch operation before it is considered a failure. Changes to this threshold can significantly impact the performance of batch operations, as a lower threshold may lead to more frequent failures and retries, increasing execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may allow larger batches to be processed more efficiently, reducing overhead. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
