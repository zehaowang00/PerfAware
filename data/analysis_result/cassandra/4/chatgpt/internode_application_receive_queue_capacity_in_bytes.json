    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity of the queue that handles incoming data between nodes in the cluster. A change in this value can lead to variations in how effectively the system can process and manage incoming requests. If the queue capacity is too low, it can result in increased latency and potential data loss during peak loads, as messages may be dropped when the queue is full. Conversely, if the capacity is set too high, it may lead to increased memory consumption and potential resource contention, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can significantly influence execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
