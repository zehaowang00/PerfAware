    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'endpoint_snitch' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system identifies and manages the topology of the nodes in the cluster. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact data distribution, replication strategies, and load balancing across nodes. If the snitch is misconfigured or changed, it can lead to uneven data distribution, increased latency, and suboptimal resource utilization, which directly affects execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
