    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' in Cassandra determines the maximum amount of disk space allocated for commit logs. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in write-heavy workloads. If the allocated space is too low, it can lead to frequent flushing of commit logs to disk, increasing I/O operations and potentially causing latency spikes. Conversely, allocating too much space may lead to inefficient disk usage and could delay the cleanup of old commit logs, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption."
