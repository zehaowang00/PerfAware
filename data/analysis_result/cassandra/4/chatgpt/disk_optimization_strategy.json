    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_optimization_strategy' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to and read from disk, which can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption. Different strategies can lead to variations in I/O performance, affecting overall throughput and latency. For instance, a strategy that optimizes for sequential writes may improve performance under heavy load, while one that prioritizes random access could degrade it. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
