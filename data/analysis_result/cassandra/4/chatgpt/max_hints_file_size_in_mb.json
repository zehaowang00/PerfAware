    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' in Cassandra directly influences how the system handles hinted handoffs, which are critical for maintaining data consistency in distributed environments. If the size limit is set too low, it can lead to frequent flushing of hint files, resulting in increased I/O operations and potentially higher latency during read and write operations. Conversely, if set too high, it can lead to excessive memory consumption and longer recovery times during node failures. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
