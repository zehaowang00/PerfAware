    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of concurrent writes that can be processed for materialized views. A higher value can lead to increased throughput and reduced latency for write operations, while a lower value may cause bottlenecks and longer execution times due to contention. This configuration significantly affects system performance, especially in write-heavy workloads, making it performance-sensitive."
