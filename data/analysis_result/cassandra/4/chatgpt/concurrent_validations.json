    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_validations' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of simultaneous validation operations that can be processed. A higher value can lead to increased resource utilization, such as CPU and memory, which can significantly affect system performance. If set too low, it may result in underutilization of resources and increased execution time for validation tasks, while setting it too high can lead to contention and potential bottlenecks, thereby causing notable variations in execution time and overall system throughput."
