    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of tokens assigned to a node in a cluster. This directly impacts data distribution and load balancing across nodes. A change in the number of tokens can lead to significant variations in how data is partitioned, which affects read and write performance, as well as the efficiency of resource utilization. If the number of tokens is too low, it may lead to hotspots and uneven load distribution, causing increased latency and resource contention. Conversely, if the number is too high, it can lead to overhead in managing more partitions than necessary, also negatively impacting performance. Therefore, changes to 'num_tokens' can significantly affect execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
