    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timeouts for inter-node communication. A change in this value can significantly affect the responsiveness and throughput of the system. If the timeout is set too low, it may lead to frequent timeouts and retries, causing increased latency and reduced performance during high-load scenarios. Conversely, if set too high, it may mask underlying issues, leading to resource contention and inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and overall system performance."
