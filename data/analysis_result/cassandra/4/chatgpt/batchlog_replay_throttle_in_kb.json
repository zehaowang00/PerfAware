    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'batchlog_replay_throttle_in_kb' in Cassandra controls the rate at which batch log replay occurs. A change in this value can significantly impact the system's performance, particularly in terms of execution time and resource utilization. If the throttle is set too low, it may lead to increased latency in processing batch operations, causing delays in read and write operations. Conversely, if set too high, it could overwhelm the system with too many concurrent operations, leading to increased memory consumption and potential instability. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in overall system performance."
