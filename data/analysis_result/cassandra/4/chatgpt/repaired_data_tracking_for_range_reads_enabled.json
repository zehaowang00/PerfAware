    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this feature can significantly impact the efficiency of read operations. When enabled, the system tracks repaired data, which can lead to increased memory usage and processing overhead during range reads. This can cause notable variations in execution time, especially in scenarios with large datasets or frequent read operations. Conversely, disabling this feature may reduce memory consumption but could lead to inconsistencies in read results, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, the value change of this configuration directly influences the performance characteristics of the system."
