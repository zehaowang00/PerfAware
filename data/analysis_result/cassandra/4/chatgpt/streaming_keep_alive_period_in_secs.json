    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the duration that streaming connections remain active during data transfers. A shorter keep-alive period may lead to increased connection establishment overhead, resulting in higher latency and resource consumption during data streaming operations. Conversely, a longer keep-alive period can lead to resource contention and increased memory usage if too many connections are maintained simultaneously. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption, impacting overall system performance."
