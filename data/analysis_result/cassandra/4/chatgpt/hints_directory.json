    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The 'hints_directory' configuration in Cassandra is primarily related to the storage of hints for failed writes and does not directly impact the core performance metrics such as execution time or memory consumption. Changes to this configuration may affect disk usage and I/O patterns, but they do not significantly alter the overall performance of the system under normal operational conditions. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
