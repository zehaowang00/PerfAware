    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' directly influences the capacity of the receive queue for internode communication in Cassandra. A change in this value can significantly impact how much data can be buffered during high-load scenarios, affecting the overall throughput and latency of data processing. If the capacity is too low, it may lead to increased message drops or delays, resulting in notable variations in execution time and resource utilization. Therefore, this configuration is critical for maintaining optimal performance in distributed operations."
