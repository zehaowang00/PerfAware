    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'trickle_fsync_interval_in_kb' in Cassandra determines the frequency at which data is flushed to disk. A lower value can lead to more frequent disk writes, which can significantly increase I/O operations and potentially degrade performance due to higher latency and increased resource contention. Conversely, a higher value may reduce the frequency of writes, which can improve throughput but risks data loss in case of a crash. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably impact execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
