    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how many concurrent writes can be processed for counter columns. A higher value can lead to increased throughput and reduced contention, which significantly affects execution time and overall system performance. Conversely, a lower value may lead to bottlenecks, increased latency, and higher memory consumption due to queuing of write operations. Therefore, changes in this configuration can notably impact the performance characteristics of the system."
