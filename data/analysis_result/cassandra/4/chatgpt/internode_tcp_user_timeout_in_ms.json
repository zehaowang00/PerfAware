    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent disconnections and reconnections, which can significantly increase latency and reduce throughput during high-load scenarios. Conversely, a higher timeout may lead to longer wait times for failed connections, potentially causing delays in data replication and impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on execution time and resource utilization."
