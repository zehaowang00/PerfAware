    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a response before considering a request failed. A lower timeout can lead to more frequent request failures, resulting in increased retries and potential resource contention, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, a higher timeout may lead to longer wait times for users and inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly impact execution time and system responsiveness, making it performance-sensitive."
