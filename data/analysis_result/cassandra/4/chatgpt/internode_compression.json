    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of data transmitted between nodes in the cluster. Enabling compression can reduce the network bandwidth usage and improve the speed of data transfer, which can lead to significant variations in execution time and overall system performance. Conversely, if compression is disabled, the increased data size can lead to higher latency and increased memory consumption during data transfer, affecting the responsiveness of the system. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on performance metrics."
