    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of cached rows that can fail before the system takes corrective action. A change in this threshold can significantly impact performance, as it directly influences how many rows can be processed efficiently in memory. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive cache misses, resulting in increased disk I/O and longer execution times. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to memory exhaustion and potential out-of-memory errors, which can severely degrade system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
