    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the number of concurrent streaming connections that can be established with a host. A higher value allows for more simultaneous data transfers, which can significantly reduce execution time during data replication and streaming operations. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks, increased latency, and higher memory consumption due to queuing of requests. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
