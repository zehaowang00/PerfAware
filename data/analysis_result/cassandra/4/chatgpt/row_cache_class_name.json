    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration in Cassandra determines the implementation of the row cache used for storing frequently accessed rows in memory. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact performance by altering the efficiency of data retrieval and memory usage. For instance, using a more efficient cache implementation can reduce execution time for read operations and lower memory consumption, while a less efficient one can lead to increased latency and higher resource usage. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
