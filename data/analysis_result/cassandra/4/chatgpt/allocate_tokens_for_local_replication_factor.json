    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in Cassandra directly influences how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this setting can significantly affect the load balancing and data replication strategy, which in turn impacts the overall system performance. If the value is altered, it can lead to uneven data distribution, increased latency in read and write operations, and higher memory consumption due to inefficient token allocation. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
