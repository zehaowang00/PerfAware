    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the garbage collection (GC) behavior of the system. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to frequent GC warnings, indicating that the application is spending excessive time in garbage collection, which can significantly degrade performance by increasing latency and reducing throughput. Conversely, if the threshold is set too high, it may mask performance issues until they become critical, leading to potential application slowdowns or crashes. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
