    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching keys. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance by affecting the speed of read operations. If the cache size is too small, it may lead to increased disk I/O as the system has to fetch keys from disk more frequently, resulting in longer execution times. Conversely, a larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need for disk access, but it may also lead to higher memory consumption. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable differences in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
