    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' in Cassandra controls how frequently the index summary is resized. A change in this interval can significantly impact the performance of read operations. If the interval is too short, it may lead to frequent resizing, causing increased CPU usage and memory consumption, which can degrade overall system performance. Conversely, if the interval is too long, it may result in inefficient memory usage and slower read times due to larger index summaries. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
