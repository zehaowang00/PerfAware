    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'hinted_handoff_enabled' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles write operations in the presence of node failures. When enabled, hinted handoff allows the system to temporarily store write requests for unavailable nodes, which can lead to increased memory consumption and potential delays in write operations if the node remains down for an extended period. If this configuration is disabled, the system may experience higher write latencies and reduced availability, significantly impacting overall performance. Therefore, changes to this setting can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization."
