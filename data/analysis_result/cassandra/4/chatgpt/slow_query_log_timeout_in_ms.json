    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging slow queries. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance by affecting how queries are logged and monitored. If the timeout is set too low, it may lead to excessive logging of queries that are not inherently slow, resulting in increased I/O operations and potential performance degradation. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause the system to miss logging important slow queries, hindering performance tuning efforts. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
