    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles disk failures, which can significantly impact data availability and recovery times. A change in this policy can lead to variations in execution time during read and write operations, especially in scenarios where disk failures occur. For instance, a more aggressive failure policy may lead to quicker failovers but can also increase the load on remaining nodes, affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a conservative policy may result in longer recovery times, impacting throughput and latency. Therefore, the choice of disk failure policy can lead to notable variations in system performance under different operational conditions."
