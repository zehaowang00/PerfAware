    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching counter values. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk I/O operations required for counter updates, leading to improved execution times and overall system throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased latency and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses, thereby impacting performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
