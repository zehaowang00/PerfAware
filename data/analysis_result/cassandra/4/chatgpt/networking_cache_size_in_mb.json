    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching network-related data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk accesses and improve data retrieval times, thereby enhancing overall system performance. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased latency and higher memory consumption due to frequent cache misses, which can degrade performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
