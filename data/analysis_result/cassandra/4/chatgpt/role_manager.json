    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in Cassandra is critical for managing user roles and permissions, which directly impacts access control and resource allocation. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in scenarios with high concurrency or complex authorization checks. If the role management settings are misconfigured or altered, it can cause delays in query processing and increased memory consumption due to inefficient role resolution, thus affecting overall system performance."
