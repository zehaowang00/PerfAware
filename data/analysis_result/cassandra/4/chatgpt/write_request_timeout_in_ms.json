    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the time allowed for write operations to complete. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts and retries, significantly increasing the overall execution time for write operations and potentially causing higher memory consumption due to the accumulation of pending requests. Conversely, if set too high, it may delay the detection of issues, leading to inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
