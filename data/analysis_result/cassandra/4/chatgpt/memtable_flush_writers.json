    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_flush_writers' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of threads responsible for flushing memtables to disk. Increasing the number of flush writers can significantly enhance write performance by allowing concurrent flushing, thereby reducing write latency and improving throughput. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to increased write amplification and longer commit times, negatively impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
