    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts how long the system waits for cache loads before timing out. A shorter timeout can lead to more frequent cache misses and increased latency in data retrieval, while a longer timeout may result in higher memory consumption due to prolonged waiting periods. Changes in this configuration can significantly affect execution time and overall system performance, especially under high load conditions where cache efficiency is critical for maintaining throughput."
