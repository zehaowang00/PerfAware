    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. Changes to the partitioner can significantly affect data locality, read/write performance, and load balancing. A poorly chosen partitioner can lead to hotspots, where some nodes handle a disproportionate amount of traffic, resulting in increased latency and reduced throughput. Additionally, it can impact the efficiency of data replication and consistency, further influencing overall system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
