    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the trade-off between consistency and performance. Changing this level can significantly impact the execution time of read and write operations, as higher consistency levels require more coordination among nodes, leading to increased latency and resource consumption. Additionally, it affects how data is replicated and acknowledged across the cluster, which can lead to variations in memory usage and overall system throughput. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
