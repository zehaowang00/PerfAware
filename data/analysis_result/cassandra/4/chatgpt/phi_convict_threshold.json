    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how aggressively the system identifies and handles unresponsive nodes. A change in this threshold can significantly impact the system's ability to detect and recover from failures, which in turn affects overall system performance, including latency and throughput. If the threshold is set too low, nodes may be prematurely marked as down, leading to unnecessary load redistribution and increased execution time for queries. Conversely, if set too high, the system may not react quickly enough to actual failures, causing delays in response times and potential data unavailability. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
