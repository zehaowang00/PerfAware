    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system will wait for a range request to complete before timing out. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts and retries, significantly increasing the overall execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause the system to hold onto resources longer than necessary, potentially leading to increased memory usage and degraded performance under load. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
