    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the row cache is saved to disk. A shorter save period can lead to increased disk I/O and potentially higher latency during write operations, while a longer save period may result in increased memory consumption and slower read performance if the cache is not updated frequently. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
