    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the capacity of the send queue for inter-node communication. A change in this value can significantly affect the throughput and latency of data being sent between nodes. If the capacity is too low, it may lead to increased backpressure, causing delays in message processing and potentially resulting in timeouts or dropped messages. Conversely, if the capacity is excessively high, it could lead to increased memory consumption, impacting the overall resource utilization of the system. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and resource usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
