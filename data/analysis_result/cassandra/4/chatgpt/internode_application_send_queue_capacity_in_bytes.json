    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra directly influences the capacity of the send queue for internode communication. A higher capacity allows for more outstanding messages to be queued, which can improve throughput under high load conditions. Conversely, a lower capacity can lead to increased latency and potential message drops if the queue becomes full, significantly impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
