    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync' configuration in Cassandra controls the frequency of flushing data to disk. A change in this setting can significantly impact I/O performance and overall system throughput. If set too low, it can lead to increased disk I/O operations, causing higher latency and reduced performance during write-heavy operations. Conversely, if set too high, it may delay data persistence, risking data loss in case of a failure. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
