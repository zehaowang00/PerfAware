    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the commit log is flushed to disk. A shorter sync period can lead to increased I/O operations, which may improve data durability and reduce the risk of data loss during failures, but it can also increase latency and reduce throughput due to more frequent disk writes. Conversely, a longer sync period can improve performance by reducing the number of writes, but it increases the risk of data loss in case of a crash. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
