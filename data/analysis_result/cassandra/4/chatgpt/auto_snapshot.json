    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's I/O operations and disk usage. When enabled, Cassandra automatically takes snapshots of data at specified intervals, which can significantly increase disk I/O and affect overall system performance, especially during heavy write operations. If the frequency or size of snapshots is altered, it can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, as the system may need to handle additional load during snapshot creation. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on the performance of the Cassandra database."
