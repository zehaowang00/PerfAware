    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. A change in this configuration can significantly affect the performance of write-heavy workloads. If the heap space is too low, it can lead to frequent flushing of memtables to disk, resulting in increased latency and reduced throughput. Conversely, if the heap space is excessively high, it can lead to inefficient memory usage and potential garbage collection issues, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
