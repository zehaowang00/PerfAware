    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of data that can be buffered for sending between nodes in the cluster. A larger buffer size can reduce the number of send operations required, leading to improved throughput and reduced latency during data replication and communication between nodes. Conversely, a smaller buffer size can lead to increased context switching and overhead, resulting in higher execution times and potential bottlenecks in data transmission. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
