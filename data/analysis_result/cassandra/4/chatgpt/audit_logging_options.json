    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact system performance because it controls the logging of audit events. If this option is set to log extensive details or a high volume of events, it can lead to increased I/O operations, higher disk usage, and greater memory consumption for buffering logs. This can result in notable variations in execution time, especially under heavy load, as the system may spend more time writing logs rather than processing requests. Conversely, if logging is minimized or disabled, the system may perform more efficiently, leading to reduced latency and better throughput."
