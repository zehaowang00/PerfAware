    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how memtables are flushed to disk and how memory is managed. A lower threshold can lead to more frequent flushing, which may increase I/O operations and potentially degrade performance if the system is not able to handle the increased load. Conversely, a higher threshold may allow for larger memtables, reducing the number of flushes but increasing memory consumption and possibly leading to out-of-memory errors if not managed correctly. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
