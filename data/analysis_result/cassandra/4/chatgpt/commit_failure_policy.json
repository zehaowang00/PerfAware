    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to write failures. Changing this policy can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving high write loads or network partitions. For instance, if the policy is set to 'abort', the system may reject writes when a failure occurs, leading to reduced throughput and increased latency. Conversely, setting it to 'ignore' may allow writes to continue at the cost of data consistency, potentially increasing performance but risking data integrity. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
