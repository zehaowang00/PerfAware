    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how memory is allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and garbage collection behavior, affecting overall system performance. For instance, using a different allocation type may result in increased latency during write operations or affect the throughput of the system, especially under heavy load. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as its adjustments can notably impact execution time and resource utilization."
