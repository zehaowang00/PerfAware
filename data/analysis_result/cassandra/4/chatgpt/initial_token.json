    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in Cassandra determines the initial token assigned to a node in a ring-based architecture. This setting is crucial for data distribution across the cluster. A change in the initial token can lead to significant variations in data load on nodes, affecting read and write performance, as well as overall cluster balance. If the initial token is not set optimally, it can cause hotspots, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption due to uneven data distribution and potential overload on specific nodes."
