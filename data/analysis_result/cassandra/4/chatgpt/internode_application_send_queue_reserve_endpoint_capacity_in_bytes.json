    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the capacity of the send queue for internode communication. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in how much data can be buffered for sending between nodes. If the capacity is too low, it may result in increased latency and reduced throughput due to frequent blocking or dropped messages, which can severely impact the overall performance of the distributed system. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage, potentially causing garbage collection pauses and affecting response times. Therefore, the adjustment of this configuration can have a notable impact on execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
