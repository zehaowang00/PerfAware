    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timing and scheduling of tasks within the system. A change in this interval can lead to variations in how often certain operations are executed, which can significantly impact overall execution time and resource utilization. For instance, a shorter timer interval may lead to more frequent task execution, increasing CPU usage and potentially causing contention, while a longer interval may delay critical operations, affecting throughput and latency. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
