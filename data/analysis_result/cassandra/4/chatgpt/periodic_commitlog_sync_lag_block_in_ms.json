    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' in Cassandra directly influences the frequency and timing of commit log synchronization. A lower value leads to more frequent sync operations, which can reduce the risk of data loss but may increase I/O operations and impact overall throughput. Conversely, a higher value can improve write performance by reducing the number of syncs but increases the risk of data loss during failures. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
