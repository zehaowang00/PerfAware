    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how the system handles tombstones, which are markers for deleted data. A change in this threshold can significantly affect the performance of read and write operations, as it determines how many tombstones can be tolerated before the system begins to experience performance degradation. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to increased garbage collection and slower query responses due to the accumulation of tombstones, while a higher threshold can allow for better performance but may risk excessive tombstone accumulation, leading to longer read times and increased memory usage. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
