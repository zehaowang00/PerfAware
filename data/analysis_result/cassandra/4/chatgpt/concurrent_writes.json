    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of write operations that can be processed simultaneously. Increasing this value can lead to higher throughput and reduced write latency, while decreasing it may result in bottlenecks and increased execution time for write operations. As a distributed database, Cassandra's performance is heavily reliant on how well it can manage concurrent operations, making this configuration critical for optimizing resource utilization and overall system performance."
