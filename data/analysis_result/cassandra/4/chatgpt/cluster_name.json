    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact the system's performance because it determines how nodes are grouped and managed within a cluster. Changes to this configuration can affect data distribution, replication strategies, and load balancing across nodes. If the cluster name is altered, it may lead to inefficient resource utilization, increased latency in data retrieval, and potential bottlenecks during data processing, all of which can notably affect execution time and memory consumption."
