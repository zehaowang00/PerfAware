    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the counter cache is written to disk. A shorter save period can lead to more frequent disk writes, which can significantly impact I/O performance and overall system throughput, especially under heavy write loads. Conversely, a longer save period may reduce the frequency of writes but could increase the risk of data loss in the event of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
