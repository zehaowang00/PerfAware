    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a write operation on counter columns before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to increased failure rates for write operations, especially under high load, resulting in significant variations in execution time and potential memory consumption due to retries or error handling. Conversely, a higher timeout may allow more operations to complete successfully but can lead to increased latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
