    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'prepared_statements_cache_size_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the caching of prepared statements, which can significantly affect query execution performance. A larger cache size can reduce the overhead of preparing statements multiple times, leading to faster execution times and lower latency for repeated queries. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased preparation time and higher memory consumption for frequently executed queries. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
