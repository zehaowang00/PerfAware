    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum duration for which hints are retained for nodes that are temporarily unavailable. A change in this value can significantly impact the performance of the system, particularly in scenarios involving node failures or network partitions. If the window is set too low, hints may be discarded before they can be applied, leading to increased read latencies and potential data inconsistencies. Conversely, a very high value may lead to excessive memory consumption as hints accumulate, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
