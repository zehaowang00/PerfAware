    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the I/O performance and disk space usage of the system. Enabling or disabling commit log compression can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially during write-heavy operations. When compression is enabled, it reduces the amount of data written to disk, which can improve write throughput and decrease latency. Conversely, if compression is disabled, the system may experience increased disk I/O and longer execution times due to larger commit logs. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect overall system performance."
