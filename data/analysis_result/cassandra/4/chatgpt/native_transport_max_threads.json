    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' in Cassandra directly influences the number of concurrent threads handling native transport requests. A higher number of threads can improve throughput and reduce latency under high load, while a lower number can lead to bottlenecks, increased response times, and underutilization of system resources. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
