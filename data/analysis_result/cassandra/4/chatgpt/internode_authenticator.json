    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the authentication process between nodes in a cluster. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in the overhead associated with authentication, which in turn affects the overall latency and throughput of inter-node communication. If the authenticator is set to a more complex or resource-intensive method, it can significantly increase the time taken for nodes to establish connections, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption due to additional processing requirements. Therefore, any modifications to this setting can have a notable impact on system performance."
