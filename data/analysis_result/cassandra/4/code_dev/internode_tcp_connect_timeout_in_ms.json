This configuration plays a critical role in ensuring that the system can effectively manage network connections between its components.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary function of this configuration is to specify the maximum time, in milliseconds, that the system will wait for a TCP connection to be established before timing out. This is crucial for maintaining the responsiveness and reliability of inter-node communication.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() Method**: This method checks if a local timeout value (`tcpConnectTimeoutInMS`) is set. If it is not set (i.e., it is `null`), it retrieves the default value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class through the `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()` method.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor Class**: This class acts as a centralized configuration holder, providing default values for various system settings, including the internode TCP connection timeout.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()` method serves as a fallback mechanism, ensuring that if a specific timeout value is not configured, the system will still function using a predefined value from `DatabaseDescriptor`. This promotes flexibility and configurability within the system.\n- The `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()` method directly interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor`, reinforcing the dependency on this class for obtaining the default timeout settings.\n\nIn summary, the `internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` configuration is essential for managing TCP connection timeouts between nodes, with its value being either user-defined or retrieved from a centralized configuration source, thereby ensuring robust inter-node communication."
