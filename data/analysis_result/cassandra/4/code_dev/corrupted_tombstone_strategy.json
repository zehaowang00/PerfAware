This strategy is defined within the `Config` class and is retrieved through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which centralizes configuration management.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` is to dictate the response of the system when it encounters invalid deletions in the data. It provides three possible behaviors:\n1. **Exception**: If the strategy is set to throw an exception, the system will raise a `CorruptSSTableException`, marking the affected SSTable as suspect. This prevents the SSTable from being included in future operations, ensuring data integrity.\n2. **Warning**: If the strategy is set to issue a warning, the system logs a warning message without interrupting the process, allowing the operation to continue while still notifying the developers of potential data issues.\n3. **Disabled**: If the strategy is disabled, the system will not perform any validation checks on the `Unfiltered` data, effectively ignoring any potential issues.\n\n#### Key Components Involved\n- **Unfiltered**: Represents the data structure being validated for invalid deletions.\n- **TableMetadata**: Provides metadata about the table, including its schema and keyspace, which is essential for understanding the context of the data.\n- **DecoratedKey**: Represents the key associated with the data, which is used for identification and logging purposes.\n- **SSTableReader**: Represents the SSTable being read, which is crucial for data retrieval and validation processes.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System\nThe `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` interacts closely with the `maybeValidateUnfiltered` and `handleInvalid` methods. When `maybeValidateUnfiltered` is called, it first checks the strategy configuration. If the strategy is not disabled and the `Unfiltered` data is present, it proceeds to check for invalid deletions. Depending on the outcome of this check and the configured strategy, it either handles the invalid data by throwing an exception or logging a warning.\n\nThis configuration ensures that the system can respond appropriately to data integrity issues, maintaining a balance between strict error handling and operational continuity. It is a vital part of the error management framework within the data processing pipeline, influencing how data anomalies are detected and reported."
