This configuration is defined in the `cassandra.yaml` file and acts as a toggle for enabling or disabling the use of UDFs in the Cassandra database.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration is to control the availability of user-defined functions, which allow users to extend the database's functionality by defining custom functions that can be executed within queries. When this configuration is set to `true`, it enables the execution of UDFs, thereby allowing developers to create more complex data processing logic directly within the database.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe method `assertUdfsEnabled(String language)` checks the state of this configuration by invoking `DatabaseDescriptor.enableUserDefinedFunctions()`. If UDFs are disabled (i.e., the configuration is set to `false`), the method throws an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that users must enable this feature in the `cassandra.yaml` file to proceed with using UDFs.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- **Key Components**: The configuration directly interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which is responsible for reading and managing various settings defined in the `cassandra.yaml` file.\n- **Interaction with Other Parts of the System**: This configuration is essential for any functionality that relies on user-defined functions. If a developer attempts to use UDFs without enabling this configuration, the system will prevent execution and raise an error, thus ensuring that users are aware of the need to enable this feature before utilizing it.\n\nIn summary, `enable_user_defined_functions` is a critical configuration that governs the use of user-defined functions in Cassandra, ensuring that developers can extend the database's capabilities while maintaining control over the execution environment."
