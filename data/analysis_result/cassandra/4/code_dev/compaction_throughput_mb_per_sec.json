This configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which provides a centralized way to retrieve system-wide settings.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of this configuration is to control the throughput of the compaction process, ensuring that it operates within specified limits. This is crucial for maintaining system stability and resource management during data compaction activities.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **RateLimiter**: The `getRateLimiter()` method utilizes the `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec` value to set the rate limit for the `RateLimiter` instance. This ensures that the compaction process adheres to the defined throughput constraints.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the source for retrieving the `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec` value. It acts as a configuration repository, making it easier to manage and access various system parameters.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `getRateLimiter()` method calls `setRate()` with the value obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor.getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec()`, effectively linking the compaction rate limiter to the configured throughput. This interaction ensures that any changes to the `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec` configuration are directly reflected in the behavior of the compaction process.\n- The `getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec()` method provides a straightforward way to access the current compaction throughput setting, allowing other parts of the system to reference this value as needed.\n\nOverall, the `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec` configuration plays a vital role in managing data compaction within the system, ensuring that it operates within defined limits while interacting seamlessly with key components like the `RateLimiter` and `DatabaseDescriptor`."
