            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `counter_cache_size_in_mb` directly influences the memory allocation for the `AutoSavingCache`. A larger cache size can lead to increased memory consumption, which may affect overall system performance, especially if the cache size approaches system limits. Additionally, the performance of cache operations (like saving and retrieving data) can be significantly impacted by the cache size, as larger caches may result in longer processing times for these operations. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for both memory usage and operational efficiency, classifying it as performance sensitive."
