It retrieves the current value, updates it with a new value provided as an argument, and logs the change.\n   - It interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to persist the new throughput setting and invokes `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateInterDCThroughput()` to ensure that any necessary adjustments are made to the streaming behavior based on the new configuration.\n\n2. **Getter Method (`getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec`)**:\n   - This method retrieves the current inter-DC stream throughput value from the `DatabaseDescriptor`, providing other components of the system access to the current configuration.\n\n3. **Calculation Method (`calculateInterDCRateInBytes`)**:\n   - This private static method calculates the inter-DC rate in bytes based on the current throughput setting. If the throughput is set to a positive value, it converts the value from megabits to bytes; otherwise, it indicates that throttling is disabled by returning `Double.MAX_VALUE`.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class for storing and retrieving the throughput value.\n- The `StreamManager` class is dependent on this configuration to adjust the streaming rate limits dynamically as the throughput setting changes.\n- The logging functionality provides visibility into changes made to the configuration, aiding in tracking and debugging.\n\nOverall, this configuration serves as a critical control point for managing data transfer rates between data centers, ensuring that the system can adapt to varying throughput requirements while maintaining operational integrity."
