Its primary purpose is to establish a time limit that determines when GC events should be recorded in the logs, allowing for better monitoring and analysis of garbage collection activities.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Garbage Collector (GC)**: The configuration interacts with the garbage collection mechanism of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is essential for understanding the timing and frequency of GC events.\n- **MBeanServer**: The configuration may depend on the MBeanServer, which facilitates the management and monitoring of the JVM's resources, including garbage collectors.\n- **GarbageCollectorMXBean**: This interface provides methods to access information about the garbage collection process, including the number of collections and the total time spent in GC.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nWhile the provided code does not directly reference `gc_log_threshold_in_ms`, it is likely that this configuration would be utilized in conjunction with logging mechanisms that monitor GC behavior. The `GCInspector` class, which initializes and queries garbage collector MBeans, could potentially leverage this configuration to filter or trigger logging based on the defined threshold.\n\nIn summary, `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` serves as a critical configuration parameter for managing and logging garbage collection events, enabling more effective monitoring of the JVM's memory management processes. Its interactions with the garbage collector and MBeanServer are essential for ensuring that relevant GC data is captured and logged based on the specified threshold."
