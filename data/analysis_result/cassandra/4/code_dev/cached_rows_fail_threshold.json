This configuration is accessed through the method `getCachedReplicaRowsFailThreshold()`, which retrieves its value from the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the `cached_rows_fail_threshold` is to manage the reliability of data retrieved from replicas in a distributed database environment. It serves as a safeguard against inconsistencies that may arise when querying data from multiple replicas. When the number of failed cached rows exceeds this threshold, it indicates potential issues with data integrity or availability, prompting the system to take appropriate actions.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing configuration values, including the `cached_rows_fail_threshold`. It acts as a centralized configuration manager for the database system.\n   \n2. **ResolveContext**: Two instances of `ResolveContext` are created within the `resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection` method. Each context maintains its own state and counters for tracking the resolution of data from replicas.\n\n3. **ReplicaFilteringProtection**: This class utilizes the `cached_rows_fail_threshold` along with a warning threshold (`cachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold`) to implement logic that ensures the integrity of data fetched from replicas.
