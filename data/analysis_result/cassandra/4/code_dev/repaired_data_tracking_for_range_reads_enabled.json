This configuration is accessed through the method `getRepairedDataTrackingEnabledForRangeReads()`, which retrieves its value from the `DatabaseDescriptor`. \n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to determine whether the system should request information about repaired data from full replicas when executing range read queries. If enabled, the system will only track repaired data when there are multiple full replicas available to compare results, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data being read.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for holding the configuration value. The method `getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()` is called to check if repaired data tracking is enabled.\n\n2. **ReplicaPlan**: The `ReplicaPlan.ForRangeRead` object is utilized to manage the contacts (replicas) involved in the range read operation. The configuration interacts with this component to assess the number of full replicas available.\n\n3. **DataResolver**: When the configuration is enabled, it influences the instantiation of the `DataResolver`, which is responsible for resolving data from the replicas. The `trackRepairedStatus` boolean is passed to the `DataResolver`, indicating whether to track repaired data based on the configuration and the number of full replicas.\n\n4. **ReadCallback**: This component handles the responses from the read operations. It is also influenced by the `trackRepairedStatus`, which determines how the responses are processed.\n\n5. **MessagingService**: The configuration affects how messages are sent to replicas. If tracking is enabled, messages will include this status, allowing replicas to respond appropriately based on whether they are full replicas or not.\n\n#### Dependencies\nThe configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for its value and interacts closely with components like `ReplicaPlan`, `DataResolver`, and `ReadCallback`. The overall functionality is contingent upon the presence of multiple full replicas to effectively compare and track repaired data.\n\nIn summary, the `repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled` configuration is essential for ensuring that the system can accurately track repaired data during range reads, thereby enhancing data integrity through its interactions with various components involved in the read process."
