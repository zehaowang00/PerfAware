If this property is set to `true`, or if it is not set (null) and the default behavior from `DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport()` is to start it, the native transport is initiated by calling `startNativeTransport()`.\n- If the transport is not started, a log message is generated, informing users that they can enable it via JMX or nodetool commands.\n\n### Dependencies and Key Components:\n- **System Property**: The configuration relies on the Java system property mechanism to retrieve its value.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component provides a default setting for whether the native transport should start if the property is not explicitly defined.\n- **StorageService**: After starting the native transport, the method sets the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) readiness state to true, indicating that the service is ready to handle incoming requests.\n\n### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration directly influences the initialization of the native transport layer, which is critical for client-server communication in Cassandra.\n- The logging mechanism provides feedback to users regarding the status of the native transport, guiding them on how to enable it if it is not started.\n\nIn summary, the `start_native_transport` configuration is essential for managing the startup of the native transport service in Cassandra, with dependencies on system properties and components like `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StorageService` to facilitate its functionality and integration within the broader system architecture."
