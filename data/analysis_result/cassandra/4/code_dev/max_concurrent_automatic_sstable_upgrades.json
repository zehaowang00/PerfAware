Its primary purpose is to limit the number of concurrent automatic upgrades that can occur simultaneously, ensuring that system resources are allocated effectively during these operations.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **CompactionStrategyManager**: This component is responsible for managing the strategies related to data compaction and upgrades. It interacts with the configuration by determining whether an upgrade task can be executed based on the current count of ongoing background upgrades.\n\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class provides access to system-wide configuration settings, including the `maxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasks()` method. This method retrieves the maximum number of concurrent upgrade tasks allowed, which is critical for the decision-making process within the `maybeRunUpgradeTask` method.\n\n3. **AbstractCompactionTask**: This represents the upgrade task that may be executed if the conditions allow. The interaction with this component is contingent on the successful retrieval of an upgrade task from the `CompactionStrategyManager`.\n\n#### Interaction within the System:\n- The `maybeRunUpgradeTask` method first logs the attempt to check for upgrade tasks. It then increments a counter (`currentlyBackgroundUpgrading`) to track the number of concurrent upgrade tasks currently in progress.\n- The method checks if the incremented value is less than or equal to the maximum allowed concurrent upgrade tasks (fetched from `DatabaseDescriptor`). If this condition is satisfied, it attempts to find an upgrade task using the `CompactionStrategyManager`.\n- If an upgrade task is found, it is executed, and the method returns true, indicating that an upgrade task was successfully run. If no tasks are available or the maximum limit is reached, the method will log that no tasks are available and return false.\n- Finally, the counter is decremented in a `finally` block to ensure that the count reflects the current state, regardless of whether an upgrade task was executed.\n\nThis configuration thus serves as a control mechanism to manage the concurrency of automatic SSTable upgrades, ensuring that the system operates within defined limits while handling data upgrades efficiently."
