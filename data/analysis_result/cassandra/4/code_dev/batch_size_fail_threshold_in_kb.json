This configuration is accessed through the method `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()`, which retrieves its value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class using the method `getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB()`.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to establish a limit on the size of data batches that can be processed before a failure is triggered. This is crucial for ensuring that the system can handle data processing efficiently and reliably.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the source of the configuration value. It encapsulates the logic for retrieving various database-related configurations, including the batch size failure threshold.\n- **getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()**: This method acts as an interface for other parts of the system to access the batch size failure threshold value, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()` method is likely called by other components of the system that manage data processing tasks. By providing a centralized way to access the batch size failure threshold, it ensures that any changes to this configuration are consistently applied throughout the system. This promotes better maintainability and adaptability of the codebase, as other components can rely on this method to obtain the current threshold value without needing to know the underlying details of how it is stored or retrieved. \n\nOverall, the `batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb` configuration plays a critical role in defining operational limits for data processing, facilitating robust interactions between various system components."
