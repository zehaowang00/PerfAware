Its primary purpose is to define the maximum duration that the system will wait for a response when processing incoming streaming messages. \n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **ConnectionCategory**: The configuration is utilized within the `tcpUserTimeoutInMS` method, which determines the appropriate timeout value based on the connection category\u2014either MESSAGING or STREAMING. This method fetches the timeout value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which centralizes configuration management.\n\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for providing the timeout values through methods like `getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()` and `getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`. These methods retrieve the configured timeout values from the database settings.\n\n3. **IncomingStreamMessage**: The configuration interacts with the `receive` method, which processes incoming stream messages. The timeout value is checked against the processing time of the message. If the processing exceeds the configured timeout, a warning is logged.\n\n4. **Metrics**: The configuration is also linked to the metrics system, which tracks the processing time of incoming messages.
