This configuration defines the preferred consistency level for write operations, which influences the behavior of the response handlers that manage these operations.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\n1. **Consistency Level Management**: The `ideal_consistency_level` serves as a reference point for the desired consistency during write operations. It allows the system to differentiate between various consistency requirements based on the specific context of a write request.\n\n2. **Response Handler Selection**: The method `getWriteResponseHandler` utilizes the `idealConsistencyLevel` parameter to decide which type of response handler to instantiate. Depending on the consistency level of the `replicaPlan`, different handlers are created:\n   - **DatacenterWriteResponseHandler**: Used when the consistency level is local to a datacenter.\n   - **DatacenterSyncWriteResponseHandler**: Applied when the consistency level is `EACH_QUORUM` and the system employs a `NetworkTopologyStrategy`.\n   - **WriteResponseHandler**: The default handler for other consistency levels.\n\n3. **Ideal Consistency Level Tracking**: The configuration allows for the tracking of the ideal consistency level during write operations. If the requested consistency level matches the ideal one, the system can utilize the same handler for both purposes. If they differ, a delegate response handler is created to monitor the ideal consistency level separately.\n\n#### Dependencies and Key Components\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for storing and retrieving the current ideal consistency level. It provides methods to get and set the consistency level, ensuring that changes are reflected throughout the system.\n- **ReplicaPlan**: This component encapsulates the details of the write operation, including the current consistency level being used. It interacts closely with the response handlers to determine how to proceed with write requests.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\nThe `ideal_consistency_level` interacts with various components of the system:\n- It influences the behavior of write response handlers, which are critical for managing how data is written across distributed nodes.\n- The configuration is checked during the instantiation of response handlers, allowing the system to adapt its behavior based on the defined ideal consistency level.\n- Changes to the ideal consistency level through the `setIdealConsistencyLevel` method can affect ongoing and future write operations, making it a dynamic aspect of the system's configuration.\n\nIn summary, the `ideal_consistency_level` configuration is essential for managing write operations in a distributed database environment, guiding the selection of response handlers and enabling consistency tracking across different contexts."
