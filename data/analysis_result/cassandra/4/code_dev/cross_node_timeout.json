It is primarily utilized in the method `getExpiresAtNanos`, which calculates the expiration timestamp based on the creation time, the current time, and a specified expiration period.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe main purpose of the `cross_node_timeout` configuration is to control whether operations can have a timeout that spans across different nodes in a distributed system. This is significant for ensuring consistency and reliability in operations that may involve multiple nodes.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method checks if the `cross_node_timeout` feature is enabled by calling `DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout()`.\n- If this feature is not enabled or if the `createdAtNanos` is greater than `currentTimeNanos`, it resets `createdAtNanos` to the current time. This ensures that the expiration time is always calculated based on a valid creation time.\n- The final expiration time is computed by adding the `expirationPeriodNanos` to the adjusted `createdAtNanos`.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is essential as it provides the method `hasCrossNodeTimeout()`, which determines the configuration's state. The behavior of the expiration calculation relies on this check to decide how to handle the creation time.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `cross_node_timeout` configuration interacts with the broader system by influencing how timeouts are managed across distributed nodes. It ensures that operations are not prematurely expired when they are created in a cross-node context, thereby maintaining operational integrity. This configuration is likely to be referenced in various parts of the system where time-sensitive operations are performed, ensuring consistent behavior across different nodes. \n\nOverall, the `cross_node_timeout` configuration is integral to managing expiration logic in a distributed environment, ensuring that timeouts are handled appropriately based on the operational context."
