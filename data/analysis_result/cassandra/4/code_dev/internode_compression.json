            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `internode_compression` configuration significantly impacts the performance of node-to-node communication in a distributed system. Compression can lead to substantial variations in data transfer times, especially in high-throughput environments where the volume of data being sent between nodes is considerable. If compression is enabled, it may reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, potentially leading to lower latency and better resource utilization. Conversely, if compression is not used when it could be beneficial, it may result in increased bandwidth usage and slower communication. Therefore, the decision to compress connections is critical and can lead to significant performance variations, classifying it as performance sensitive."
