This allows for more efficient memory management and can help in scenarios where large datasets are being processed.\n- **Cleaning Threshold**: The `cleaningThreshold` is derived from another configuration and is used to determine when to trigger cleanup operations on the memtables, ensuring that memory usage remains within acceptable limits.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **MemtablePool**: This is the primary component that manages the allocation of memory for memtables. Depending on the `memtableAllocationType`, different pooling strategies (like `SlabPool` or `NativePool`) are employed to handle memory allocation effectively.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as a central point for retrieving various configuration settings, including the `memtable_offheap_space_in_mb` and other related parameters.\n\n### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `createMemtableAllocatorPool` method interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor` to fetch configuration values, which are then used to instantiate the appropriate memtable pool based on the allocation type.\n- The `MemtableCleaner`, which is defined as `ColumnFamilyStore::flushLargestMemtable`, is also integrated into this configuration, indicating that it will be responsible for managing the flushing of the largest memtable when certain conditions are met.\n\nIn summary, the `memtable_offheap_space_in_mb` configuration is essential for defining the off-heap memory limits for memtables, influencing how memory is allocated and managed within the system, and interacting closely with other components like the `MemtablePool` and `DatabaseDescriptor`."
