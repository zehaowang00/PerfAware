Its primary purpose is to determine whether incremental backups are enabled, allowing the system to create backup links for SSTables only when this feature is active.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component plays a crucial role by providing the method `isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()`, which checks the status of the incremental backups configuration. If this method returns `false`, the backup process is aborted.\n\n2. **SSTableReader**: This class represents the SSTables that are subject to backup. The `maybeIncrementallyBackup` method iterates over a collection of these readers to perform backup operations.\n\n3. **Directories**: This utility is responsible for determining the appropriate backup directory for each SSTable based on its descriptor. The method `getBackupsDirectory()` is used to retrieve the path where backups will be stored.\n\n4. **FileUtils**: This utility is used to obtain the canonical path of the backup directory, ensuring that the links created for the backups are valid and accessible.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `maybeIncrementallyBackup` method is the main entry point for initiating the backup process. It first checks the status of the incremental backups configuration. If backups are enabled, it proceeds to create backup links for each SSTable in the provided iterable.\n- The `isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()` method serves as a straightforward accessor to the configuration status, allowing other parts of the system to query whether incremental backups are allowed.\n\nIn summary, the `incremental_backups` configuration is essential for controlling the backup operations of SSTables, ensuring that backups are only attempted when explicitly enabled, and facilitating the organization of backup files through the use of various utility classes."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The incremental backups process involves iterating over potentially large collections of SSTableReader objects and performing file operations, such as creating links and obtaining canonical paths. These operations can be time-intensive, especially if the number of SSTables is substantial or if the file system is slow. Consequently, enabling or disabling this configuration can lead to significant variations in performance, particularly during backup operations, which can impact overall system responsiveness and resource utilization."
