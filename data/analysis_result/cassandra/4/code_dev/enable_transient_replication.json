The configuration interacts with instances of this class to validate and enforce the rules regarding transient replicas.\n   \n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for managing system-wide settings, including the transient replication setting. The configuration checks if transient replication is enabled by querying `DatabaseDescriptor.isTransientReplicationEnabled()`.\n\n3. **TokenMetadata and IEndpointSnitch**: These components provide information about the cluster's topology and the location of nodes. They are essential for determining how data is distributed and replicated across the cluster.\n\n4. **Preconditions**: The configuration utilizes the `Preconditions` class to enforce rules regarding the replication factors, ensuring that transient replicas are only allowed under specific conditions.\n\n#### Functionality and Interactions:\n- The `validateReplicationStrategy` method checks if the specified replication strategy can accommodate transient replicas. If transient replicas are requested but the configuration is disabled, it throws a `ConfigurationException`, prompting users to enable it in the `cassandra.yaml` file.\n  \n- The `validate` method further enforces rules around replication factors, ensuring that transient replication is only allowed when certain conditions are met, such as having a single token and ensuring that transient replicas do not exceed the total replication factor.\n\n- Additionally, it verifies that transient replication is not used in clusters with mixed versions of nodes, specifically those running versions lower than 4.0, to maintain compatibility and stability.\n\nIn summary, the `enable_transient_replication` configuration is integral to defining how transient data is handled in Cassandra, ensuring that the system adheres to specific rules and dependencies related to replication strategies and cluster topology."
