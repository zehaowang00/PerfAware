It ensures that streaming is only performed when certain conditions are met, specifically when full SSTable transfers are allowed and when there are no legacy counter shards present in the SSTable metadata.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for managing various system configurations, including the `stream_entire_sstables` setting. It acts as the source of truth for whether full SSTable streaming is enabled.\n2. **SSTableMetadata**: This object contains metadata about the SSTables, including a flag (`hasLegacyCounterShards`) that indicates the presence of legacy counter shards, which can affect streaming decisions.\n3. **Reference (`ref`)**: This is a reference to the current SSTable being evaluated. It is used to access the metadata and determine the appropriate streaming behavior based on the configuration.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables` method checks the state of the `stream_entire_sstables` configuration and the metadata of the current SSTable.

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `stream_entire_sstables` configuration directly impacts the performance of data transfer processes involving SSTables. If full SSTable transfers are enabled, it can lead to substantial memory and time consumption during streaming operations, especially with large datasets. Conversely, if disabled, it prevents potentially time-intensive operations from occurring, thereby optimizing performance. The decision to stream or not based on this configuration can result in significant variations in system performance, making it a critical factor in managing resource utilization effectively."
