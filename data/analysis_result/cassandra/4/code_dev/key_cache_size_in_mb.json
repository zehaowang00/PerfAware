This value is then converted into bytes to determine the total memory capacity for the cache.\n- The key cache is implemented using an `AutoSavingCache` that wraps around a `CaffeineCache`, which is created with the specified memory capacity. This setup allows for efficient caching of `KeyCacheKey` and `RowIndexEntry` objects.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **AutoSavingCache**: This is the main cache object that automatically saves its contents based on a defined schedule.\n- **CaffeineCache**: A high-performance caching library that provides the underlying cache implementation.\n- **KeyCacheSerializer**: Responsible for serializing the cache entries, ensuring that they can be saved and retrieved correctly.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: A class that provides configuration values, including the key cache size and other related parameters.\n\n### Interactions:\n- The `initKeyCache` method logs the initialization process, indicating the cache size being used.\n- It also schedules the cache to save its contents periodically, using configurations like `DatabaseDescriptor.getKeyCacheSavePeriod()` and `DatabaseDescriptor.getKeyCacheKeysToSave()`.

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `key_cache_size_in_mb` directly influences the memory allocation for the key cache, which can significantly impact system performance. A larger cache size allows for more key-value pairs to be stored in memory, reducing the need for time-intensive disk I/O operations when accessing frequently used data. Conversely, setting this size too low can lead to increased cache misses and slower performance due to frequent data retrieval from slower storage. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to substantial performance differences, classifying it as performance sensitive."
