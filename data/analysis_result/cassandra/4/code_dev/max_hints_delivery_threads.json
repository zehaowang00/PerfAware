            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_hints_delivery_threads` parameter directly influences the concurrency level of hint delivery, which can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the number of delivery threads allows for more simultaneous processing of hints, potentially reducing latency and improving throughput during high-load scenarios. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks and delays in hint processing, especially in systems with high message volumes. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to substantial performance differences, classifying it as performance sensitive."
