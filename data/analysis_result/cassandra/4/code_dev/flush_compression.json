            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `flush_compression` configuration directly impacts the throughput of the compressor during flush operations, which can significantly affect write performance, especially for large tables. If the flush compression is set to `none`, it disables compression entirely, which can lead to increased I/O operations and longer write times. Conversely, if set to `fast`, it allows the system to utilize a faster compression algorithm, thereby optimizing resource usage and reducing potential bottlenecks during data flushing. The ability to adaptively select compression strategies based on operational context indicates that this configuration can lead to substantial variations in system performance, classifying it as performance sensitive."
