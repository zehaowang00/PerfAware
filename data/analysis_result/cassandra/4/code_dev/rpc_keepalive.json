It is utilized in the initialization of the `PipelineConfigurator`, which is responsible for setting up the communication pipeline for handling network events and data transmission.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Builder Pattern**: The `Server` constructor accepts a `Builder` object, which encapsulates various configuration parameters, including `tlsEncryptionPolicy`, `workerGroup`, and `pipelineConfigurator`. This pattern promotes flexibility and readability in configuring the server.\n\n2. **Worker Group**: The configuration determines the type of worker group to be used for handling I/O operations. If a custom `workerGroup` is not provided, the server defaults to either an `EpollEventLoopGroup` or a `NioEventLoopGroup`, depending on the `useEpoll` flag. This choice affects how the server manages concurrent connections.\n\n3. **Pipeline Configurator**: The `rpc_keepalive` setting is passed to the `PipelineConfigurator`, which configures the server's networking behavior, including the keep-alive mechanism for RPC connections. This ensures that inactive connections can be maintained or closed appropriately, enhancing the reliability of communication.\n\n4. **DatabaseDescriptor**: The `rpc_keepalive` value is retrieved from the `DatabaseDescriptor`, indicating a dependency on the database configuration for its value. This suggests that the server's RPC behavior is closely tied to the database's operational parameters.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `rpc_keepalive` configuration influences how the server interacts with clients over RPC by potentially keeping connections alive longer, thus reducing the likelihood of dropped connections during periods of inactivity.\n- The `EventNotifier`, which is registered with various components such as `StorageService` and `Schema`, may also utilize the keep-alive settings indirectly to manage connection tracking and notifications effectively.\n\nIn summary, the `rpc_keepalive` configuration is integral to ensuring stable and reliable RPC communication within the server, influencing how connections are maintained and managed in conjunction with other system components."
