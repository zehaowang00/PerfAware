By requiring a higher phi value (specifically, double the threshold) before convicting a node, the system aims to minimize the risk of incorrectly identifying a healthy node as failed, which could lead to unnecessary disruptions in repair processes.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing the actual value of the `phi_convict_threshold`. The method `getPhiConvictThreshold()` retrieves this configuration value from the `DatabaseDescriptor`.\n2. **convict Methods**: There are two overloaded `convict` methods that utilize the `phi_convict_threshold`.
