If this threshold is set improperly, it could lead to excessive garbage collection cycles or delays, causing time-intensive operations that degrade application responsiveness and throughput. Given that garbage collection can be a memory-intensive and time-consuming process, especially in systems with high memory usage or large object allocations, this configuration can directly influence the performance of the entire system."
