            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The size of the counter cache directly affects memory usage, as the cache capacity is calculated based on the configuration value multiplied by 1024 * 1024 to convert from MB to bytes. A larger cache can lead to significant memory consumption, which can impact overall system performance, especially if the cache size is set to a high value. Additionally, the scheduling of cache saves based on the number of keys to save can also affect performance if the save operations are time-intensive, making this configuration critical for performance considerations."
