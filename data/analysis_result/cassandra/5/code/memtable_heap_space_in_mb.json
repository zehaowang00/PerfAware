            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `memtable_heap_space_in_mb` directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are critical for write operations in a database. A higher heap space can lead to improved write performance by reducing the frequency of flushing to disk, while insufficient heap space can cause increased garbage collection and slower performance due to frequent flushing. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to significant performance impacts, making it performance sensitive."
