If this value is improperly set or defaults to a suboptimal configuration, it can lead to bottlenecks in message delivery, causing time-intensive operations that degrade overall system performance. The retrieval of this configuration from `DatabaseDescriptor` indicates that it may have substantial implications for resource allocation and performance, making it critical to manage effectively."
