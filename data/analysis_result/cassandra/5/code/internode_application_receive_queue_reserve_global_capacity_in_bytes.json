The initialization of the `MessagingService` and the scheduling of unused connection monitoring do not suggest substantial performance impact on system-level operations. The configuration in question appears to be related to queue capacity, but without further context on how it directly affects performance through heavy operations, it cannot be classified as performance-sensitive."
