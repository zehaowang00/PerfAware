            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `cached_rows_fail_threshold` directly influences how the system handles replica filtering and read repair processes, which are critical for ensuring data consistency in distributed databases. If this threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive read repairs and unnecessary querying of replicas, resulting in time-intensive operations that can significantly degrade performance. Conversely, if set too high, it could allow outdated data to be processed, potentially leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its role in managing memory and processing time during data retrieval operations."
