While enabling scripted UDFs may have implications for security and functionality, it does not directly lead to substantial system-level performance impacts due to time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The configuration itself does not cause significant performance variations; rather, it is a toggle that affects the execution of user-defined functions, which may vary in performance based on their implementation rather than the configuration itself."
