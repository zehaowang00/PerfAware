If the synchronization period is too long, it may lead to increased latency in data availability and potential data loss in case of failures. Conversely, a very short synchronization period may lead to excessive resource usage and contention, impacting overall system throughput. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its direct correlation with time-intensive operations related to data consistency and durability."
