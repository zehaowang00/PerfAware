            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The choice of commit log synchronization method (periodic, batch, or group) can significantly impact the performance of the system due to the varying time and resource requirements associated with each method. For instance, batch synchronization may lead to higher throughput but can also introduce latency, while periodic synchronization may reduce resource usage but can increase the risk of data loss in case of failures. The performance implications of these configurations are substantial, as they directly influence the efficiency of commit log processing, making it a critical aspect of system performance."
