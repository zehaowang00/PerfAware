            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_hints_delivery_threads` directly influences the number of concurrent threads available for delivering hints, which can significantly affect the throughput and latency of hint delivery operations. If set too low, it can lead to bottlenecks and increased latency in processing hints, while setting it too high can lead to excessive context switching and resource contention. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its potential to cause time-intensive operations during hint delivery."
