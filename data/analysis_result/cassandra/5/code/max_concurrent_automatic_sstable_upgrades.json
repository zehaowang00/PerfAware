            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_concurrent_auto_upgrade_tasks` setting directly influences the number of concurrent upgrade tasks that can be executed, which can significantly impact system performance. If this value is set too high, it may lead to resource contention and increased memory usage due to multiple tasks running simultaneously, potentially causing time-intensive operations that degrade overall system performance. Conversely, if set too low, it may underutilize system resources and prolong upgrade times, also impacting performance. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial effect on the system's performance characteristics."
