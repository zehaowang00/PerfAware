If this size is set too high, it could lead to excessive memory usage as the system attempts to handle large amounts of data, potentially causing memory exhaustion or degraded performance. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to increased I/O operations, as the system would need to write more frequently, which can be time-intensive. Thus, the configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its influence on both memory and time-intensive operations."
