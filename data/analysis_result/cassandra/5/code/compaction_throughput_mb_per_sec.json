If set too low, it may lead to prolonged compaction times and increased latency for read and write operations. Conversely, if set too high, it could overwhelm system resources, leading to potential memory issues or degraded performance during peak loads. Thus, this configuration can cause substantial variations in performance due to its impact on time-intensive operations related to data management."
