            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `networking_cache_size_in_mb` directly affects the `NETWORKING_MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD`, which is critical for managing buffers used in client-server or inter-node requests. Since these buffers are intended to be short-lived and released immediately after use, any misconfiguration leading to excessive memory allocation could significantly impact the performance of network operations, causing delays and increased latency in message processing. Given that networking operations are often time-sensitive, the memory usage threshold here can lead to substantial performance variations if not managed properly."
