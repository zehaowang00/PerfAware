            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs` directly influences the frequency of the keep-alive tasks scheduled for the channel. A shorter keep-alive period may lead to more frequent task executions, which can increase CPU usage and resource contention, especially in high-load scenarios. Conversely, a longer period may delay error detection and recovery, impacting overall system responsiveness. Given that these tasks can be time-intensive and affect system performance significantly, this configuration is classified as performance sensitive."
