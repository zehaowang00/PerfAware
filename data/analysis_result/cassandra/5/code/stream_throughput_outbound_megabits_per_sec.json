Adjusting this value impacts the rate at which data is processed and transmitted, potentially leading to time-intensive operations if set too low, or resource contention if set too high. The method `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateThroughput()` indicates that changes to this configuration can lead to immediate adjustments in resource allocation, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
