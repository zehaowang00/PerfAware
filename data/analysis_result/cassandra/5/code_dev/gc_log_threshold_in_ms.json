Its primary purpose is to establish a time limit that determines when a GC event should be logged, allowing for better monitoring and analysis of garbage collection behavior.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Garbage Collector MXBeans**: The configuration interacts with the garbage collector management beans (MXBeans) that provide information about the garbage collection process in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). These beans are accessed through the MBean server, which is a part of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) framework.\n- **MBean Server**: The MBean server acts as a registry for the MXBeans and facilitates the interaction between the application and the management tools. The `GCInspector` class initializes and queries this server to gather information about the garbage collectors available in the system.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` configuration is likely used in conjunction with the `GCInspector` class to determine when to log GC events based on their duration. Although the provided code does not explicitly reference this configuration, it is expected that the logging mechanism would utilize this threshold to filter out less significant GC events, focusing on those that exceed the specified duration.\n- The configuration may also interact with monitoring tools or frameworks that rely on GC logging for performance analysis and system diagnostics.\n\nIn summary, `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` serves as a critical configuration parameter that influences how garbage collection events are logged, thereby aiding in the overall monitoring and management of the JVM's memory management processes."
