This configuration plays a critical role in managing the flow of messages between nodes in a distributed system.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to allocate a specific amount of memory for the send queue, which temporarily holds messages that are to be sent to other nodes. By reserving a defined capacity, the system can ensure that there is sufficient space for outgoing messages, thereby facilitating smooth communication between nodes.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- **Queue Management**: The configuration helps in managing the size of the send queue, preventing it from overflowing and ensuring that messages can be queued without immediate loss.\n- **Message Flow Control**: By setting a global capacity, the configuration aids in controlling the rate at which messages are sent, allowing for better synchronization between sending and receiving nodes.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **MessagingService**: The `MessagingService` class is likely to utilize this configuration to initialize the send queue with the specified capacity. It may interact with other components responsible for message delivery and connection management.\n- **OutboundConnections**: This component may also depend on the configuration to monitor and manage the connections between nodes, ensuring that the send queue operates within the defined limits.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes` configuration interacts with various components of the messaging system, including:\n- **Message Producers**: These components will rely on the send queue's capacity to determine how many messages can be queued at any given time.\n- **Connection Handlers**: They may use the configuration to optimize the handling of outgoing messages based on the available queue capacity.\n\nIn summary, the `internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes` configuration is essential for ensuring effective message queuing and flow control in a distributed messaging system, with dependencies on key components like `MessagingService` and `OutboundConnections` for its implementation and functionality."
