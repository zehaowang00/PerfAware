It retrieves the CDC space configuration from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class using the method `getCDCSpaceInMB()`, which returns the space in megabytes. This value is then converted to bytes by multiplying it by 1024 twice (once for kilobytes and once for bytes).\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as a central point for accessing various database configurations, including the CDC space allocation.\n- **getCDCSpaceInMB()**: A method within the `DatabaseDescriptor` that provides the configured CDC space in megabytes.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `allowableCDCBytes` method interacts directly with the `DatabaseDescriptor` to fetch the configuration value, ensuring that the application has access to the current CDC space allocation. This method is likely used in other parts of the system where the total CDC space needs to be referenced or enforced, thereby linking the configuration to the operational aspects of data management and change tracking in the database. \n\nOverall, this configuration plays a crucial role in defining how much data can be captured for changes, influencing the system's ability to track and manage data modifications effectively."

The retrieval of the CDC space configuration from `DatabaseDescriptor` is unlikely to involve time-intensive or memory-intensive operations, as it typically accesses a stored configuration value rather than performing complex calculations or data manipulations.
