It acts as a configuration repository, ensuring that different parts of the system can access consistent configuration values.\n- **Logger**: The logging mechanism is utilized to issue warnings when the number of tables exceeds the defined threshold, ensuring that system administrators are alerted to potential issues.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `clientWarnings` method checks the current number of tables against the `table_count_warn_threshold`.
