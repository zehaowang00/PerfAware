The method `getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB()` fetches the configured size in megabytes, which is essential for setting up the memory pool.\n- **IndexSummaryManager**: This class utilizes the capacity value to initialize its internal memory management. The constructor retrieves the size and logs the initialization process, ensuring that the system's state is documented for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nUpon instantiation of the `IndexSummaryManager`, the configuration value is used to set the memory pool capacity through the method `setMemoryPoolCapacityInMB()`. This interaction ensures that the manager operates within the defined constraints, allowing it to efficiently handle index summaries as part of the broader data management strategy.\n\nOverall, the `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration is integral to the proper functioning of the `IndexSummaryManager`, influencing how it allocates resources and interacts with other components responsible for data indexing and retrieval."
