Its primary purpose is to determine whether hinted handoff is enabled or disabled, which is essential for ensuring data consistency and availability in distributed environments.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is central to the configuration, providing methods such as `hintedHandoffEnabled()` and `hintedHandoffDisabledDCs()`.
