A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of cache misses and improve the overall performance of the system by minimizing time-intensive operations related to data fetching. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased memory pressure and frequent evictions, resulting in performance degradation. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance due to its influence on memory usage and access times."
