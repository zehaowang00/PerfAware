This configuration allows the system to track and manage the desired consistency level for write operations, which is essential for ensuring data integrity across different nodes.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe ideal consistency level serves as a reference point for write operations.

This is particularly important in scenarios where different nodes may have varying consistency requirements based on their geographical location or network topology.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions\n1. **AbstractWriteResponseHandler**: This is the primary handler that manages the response for write operations.

The methods `getIdealConsistencyLevel()` and `setIdealConsistencyLevel(String cl)` are used to access and modify this configuration.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\n- The `getWriteResponseHandler` method utilizes the ideal consistency level to potentially create a delegate response handler that tracks the ideal level. If the ideal consistency level matches the requested consistency level, the same handler is used for tracking.\n- The configuration interacts with the write response handlers to ensure that they can adapt based on the ideal consistency level, facilitating a more flexible and robust write operation strategy.\n\nIn summary, the ideal consistency level configuration is integral to managing how write operations are executed in a distributed environment, ensuring that the system can maintain data consistency according to predefined standards."
