This configuration determines whether the system allows the removal of compact storage from tables.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to control the ability to drop compact storage from tables. When enabled, it permits modifications to table storage formats, which can be essential for schema evolution and data management.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Validation Check**: The configuration is checked using `DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()`. If it is disabled, an `InvalidRequestException` is thrown, preventing the operation from proceeding.\n2. **Table Type Verification**: The method verifies if the target table is a compact table. If the table does not support compact storage, an error is raised, ensuring that only appropriate tables can undergo this operation.\n3. **Flag Management**: Depending on whether the table is a counter, the method sets specific flags that dictate the behavior of the table after the operation. This involves using an immutable set of flags to ensure the integrity of the table's metadata.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for holding configuration settings, including the `enable_drop_compact_storage` flag.\n- **KeyspaceMetadata and TableMetadata**: These classes represent the schema definitions for keyspaces and tables, respectively, and are integral to the operation of modifying table storage formats.\n- **Flag Enumeration**: This is used to define the properties of the table after the drop operation, ensuring that the table's metadata is accurately updated.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe configuration interacts with the broader schema management system by enforcing rules around table modifications. It ensures that only valid operations are performed on tables, thus maintaining the integrity of the database schema. The method ultimately returns an updated `KeyspaceMetadata` object that reflects the changes made to the table's metadata, facilitating seamless integration with other components that rely on accurate schema definitions. \n\nIn summary, `enable_drop_compact_storage` serves as a gatekeeper for schema modifications related to compact storage, ensuring that operations are performed safely and within the defined constraints of the system."
