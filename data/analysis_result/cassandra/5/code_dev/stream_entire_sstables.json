This configuration is primarily accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables()` method, which returns a boolean indicating if full SSTable transfers are enabled.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to control the behavior of data streaming within the system, specifically in relation to SSTables. It ensures that streaming operations are only performed when certain conditions are met, thereby maintaining the integrity and consistency of data transfer processes.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe `computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables` method evaluates two key conditions:\n1. It checks if full SSTable transfers are enabled via the `DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables()` method.\n2. It verifies the presence of legacy counter shards in the SSTable metadata, which could indicate compatibility issues.\n\nIf either of these conditions is not satisfied (i.e., streaming is disabled or legacy counter shards are present), the method returns `false`, indicating that the system should not proceed with streaming the entire SSTables. Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the current reference is contained within the specified sections.\n\n#### Dependencies and Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for managing system-wide configurations, including the `stream_entire_sstables` setting.\n- **SSTableMetadata**: This component provides metadata about the SSTables, including information about legacy counter shards, which is critical for determining the streaming capability.\n- **Reference Object (`ref`)**: This is used to access the current SSTable's metadata and check its compatibility with the streaming process.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe configuration interacts with the data streaming logic by acting as a gatekeeper for the streaming process. It ensures that only compatible SSTables are streamed, thereby preventing potential issues that could arise from attempting to stream SSTables that contain legacy structures. This interaction is essential for maintaining a robust data transfer mechanism within the system."

If full SSTable transfers are enabled, it can lead to significant memory and time consumption during streaming, especially with large datasets. Conversely, if disabled, it prevents potentially time-consuming and resource-intensive operations, thereby optimizing performance. The decision to stream or not can lead to substantial variations in system performance, making this configuration critical for performance sensitivity."
