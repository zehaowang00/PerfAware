Its primary purpose is to establish the server's operational parameters, particularly concerning the transport layer and connection management.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n\n1. **Socket**: The server uses a socket obtained from the builder, which is essential for network communication.\n\n2. **TLS Encryption Policy**: This configuration specifies the security protocol for encrypting data transmitted over the network, ensuring secure connections.\n\n3. **Worker Group**: The configuration allows for the specification of a `workerGroup`. If not provided, it defaults to either an `EpollEventLoopGroup` or a `NioEventLoopGroup`, depending on the `useEpoll` flag. This choice affects how the server handles concurrent connections and I/O operations.\n\n4. **Pipeline Configurator**: The `pipelineConfigurator` is crucial for setting up the channel pipeline, which defines how incoming and outgoing data is processed. If not explicitly set in the builder, it defaults to a new instance of `PipelineConfigurator`, initialized with parameters such as:\n   - `useEpoll`: Indicates whether to use epoll for I/O operations.\n   - `DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive()`: Configures keep-alive settings for RPC connections.\n   - `DatabaseDescriptor.useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher()`: This is directly related to the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` configuration, determining how flushing of data is handled in the transport layer.\n\n5. **Event Notifier**: An `EventNotifier` instance is created to track connection events. If not provided, a default instance is used. This notifier is registered with the `StorageService` and `Schema` instances, facilitating event-driven interactions within the system.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n\nThe configuration interacts closely with the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to retrieve necessary operational parameters, such as keep-alive settings and flushing behavior. The choice of worker group impacts how the server processes connections, while the pipeline configurator defines the data handling mechanism, ensuring that the server can efficiently manage network traffic.\n\nOverall, the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` configuration plays a vital role in defining the server's transport behavior, security, and event management, ensuring that it operates effectively within the broader system architecture."
