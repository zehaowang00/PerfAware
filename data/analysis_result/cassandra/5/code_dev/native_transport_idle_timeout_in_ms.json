This configuration is utilized in the `configureInitialPipeline` method, where it plays a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of network connections.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Idle Timeout Management**: The primary purpose of this configuration is to specify a timeout period after which idle connections will be closed. If a connection remains inactive for the defined duration, it is automatically terminated to free up resources and maintain system stability.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **ChannelPipeline**: This is a fundamental component of the Netty framework that manages the sequence of handlers for processing inbound and outbound data. The `IDLE_STATE_HANDLER` is added to the pipeline based on the `native_transport_idle_timeout` value.\n- **IdleStateHandler**: This handler is responsible for monitoring the idle state of the channel. It uses the `idleTimeout` value to determine when to trigger the closure of idle connections.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `IDLE_STATE_HANDLER` interacts with the `ChannelHandlerContext` to monitor the state of the connection. When the idle timeout is reached, the overridden `channelIdle` method is invoked, which logs the closure of the connection and executes the `ctx.close()` method to terminate the connection.\n- This configuration is dependent on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which provides the method `nativeTransportIdleTimeout()` to retrieve the configured timeout value.\n\nOverall, the `native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms` configuration is essential for ensuring that idle connections do not linger indefinitely, thus contributing to effective resource management within the system."
