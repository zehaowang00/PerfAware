            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes` directly influences the frequency at which the index summary's memory pool is resized. Since resizing can involve significant memory allocation and deallocation operations, which are time-intensive, this configuration can lead to substantial variations in system performance. If the interval is set too short, it may cause frequent resizing, leading to increased overhead and potential performance degradation. Conversely, if set too long, it may lead to inefficient memory usage. Therefore, this configuration has a considerable impact on the overall performance of the system."
