This configuration is managed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class and is leveraged in various error handling methods, including `handleCorruptSSTable` and `handleFSError`.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the `disk_failure_policy` is to define the operational behavior of the system in the event of disk failures. It provides a mechanism to ensure data integrity and system stability by specifying how to handle different types of errors that may arise from disk issues. The policy can take several forms, including:\n\n- **stop_paranoid**: The system will stop all transports immediately upon detecting a disk failure, ensuring that no further operations are attempted that could lead to data corruption.\n- **stop**: Similar to `stop_paranoid`, this policy also halts operations but may allow for some additional handling before stopping.\n- **best_effort**: This policy allows the system to attempt to continue operating under certain conditions but will stop transports if critical issues are detected, such as full disks or unwritable paths.\n- **ignore**: Under this policy, the system logs the error but continues operation without taking further action.\n- **die**: This policy results in a forceful shutdown of the JVM if a disk failure is encountered during startup.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies\n1. **StorageService**: This class is responsible for managing the overall storage operations within the system. It interacts with the `disk_failure_policy` to determine whether to stop transports based on the current policy.\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the configuration holder for various system parameters, including the `disk_failure_policy`. It provides methods to retrieve the current policy and is central to the decision-making process in error handling.\n3. **Error Handling Methods**: The methods `handleCorruptSSTable` and `handleFSError` utilize the `disk_failure_policy` to decide on the appropriate course of action when encountering exceptions related to disk failures.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\nThe `disk_failure_policy` interacts closely with the error handling mechanisms of the system. When an error is detected, such as a `CorruptSSTableException` or `FSError`, the relevant handling method checks the current policy to determine the appropriate response. This may involve stopping transports to prevent further operations that could lead to data loss or corruption. Additionally, the policy influences how the system marks directories as unwritable or unreadable, ensuring that administrators are alerted to issues that require manual intervention.\n\nIn summary, the `disk_failure_policy` serves as a safeguard against disk-related failures, guiding the system's response to ensure stability and data integrity. It is a vital part of the error handling framework and interacts with key components like `StorageService` and `DatabaseDescriptor` to maintain operational reliability."
