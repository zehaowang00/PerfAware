This setting is defined in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file and is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration is to control the availability of user-defined functions in the Cassandra database. When this setting is enabled (set to `true`), it allows users to define and execute custom functions within their queries, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the database operations.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe method `assertUdfsEnabled` checks the status of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration. If UDFs are disabled (i.e., the configuration is set to `false`), the method throws an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that UDFs cannot be used unless the configuration is modified to enable them.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for reading and managing various configuration settings, including `enable_user_defined_functions`. It acts as a central point for accessing configuration values.\n- **cassandra.yaml**: This is the primary configuration file for Cassandra where various operational parameters, including the UDF setting, are defined.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `assertUdfsEnabled` method interacts directly with the configuration by invoking `DatabaseDescriptor.enableUserDefinedFunctions()`. This method call retrieves the current state of the UDF configuration, influencing the behavior of the application based on whether UDFs are allowed or not. If UDFs are disabled, the method ensures that any attempts to use them are met with an appropriate error message, thus enforcing the configuration's constraints on the system's functionality.\n\nIn summary, the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration is essential for controlling the use of custom functions in Cassandra, ensuring that the system adheres to the defined operational policies set in the configuration file."
