            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `flush_compression` configuration directly impacts the throughput of the compressor during flush operations, which can significantly affect the performance of the system. When flushing large tables, the choice of compression algorithm can lead to substantial variations in write latency and memory usage. A slower compression algorithm may cause flushes to queue up and block writes, leading to performance degradation. Therefore, the configuration's ability to switch to a faster compressor is critical for maintaining optimal performance during intensive data operations."
