This configuration is crucial for managing the rate at which data is compacted, ensuring that the system can handle data efficiently without overwhelming resources.\n\n### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for retrieving the configuration value for `compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec`. It acts as a central point for accessing various system configurations.\n2. **RateLimiter**: The `getRateLimiter()` method utilizes the throughput value obtained from `DatabaseDescriptor` to set the rate limit for the `compactionRateLimiter`. This component controls the rate of data compaction, ensuring it adheres to the specified limit.\n\n### Interaction within the System:\n- The `getRateLimiter()` method retrieves the compaction throughput value and applies it to the `compactionRateLimiter`. This establishes a controlled environment for compaction processes, allowing them to operate within defined limits.\n- The method `getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec()` serves as a direct accessor for the compaction throughput configuration, enabling other parts of the system to query the current setting as needed.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a vital role in regulating data compaction activities, facilitating smooth operations within the system while interacting closely with the `DatabaseDescriptor` and `RateLimiter` components."

Setting this configuration affects how quickly the system can process and compact data, impacting overall system performance significantly. If the throughput is set too high, it may lead to resource contention and degraded performance, while a low setting could slow down data processing, affecting system responsiveness. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance."
