Its primary purpose is to determine whether the system should collect and utilize information regarding repaired data when querying sub-ranges of data across replicas.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing the configuration value through the method `getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()`. It acts as the source of truth for whether repaired data tracking is enabled.\n\n2. **ReplicaPlan**: This class is involved in defining the set of replicas that will be queried. The configuration influences how the system interacts with these replicas, particularly when determining if multiple full replicas are available for comparison.\n\n3. **PartitionRangeReadCommand**: This command is constructed for querying specific sub-ranges of data.
