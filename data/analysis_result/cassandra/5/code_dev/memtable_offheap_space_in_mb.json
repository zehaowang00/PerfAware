Insufficient off-heap memory can lead to increased garbage collection, higher latency in write operations, and potential out-of-memory errors, significantly impacting overall system performance. The choice between different memory allocation strategies (e.g., `offheap_buffers` vs. `offheap_objects`) further emphasizes the importance of this configuration in optimizing memory usage and performance in high-throughput scenarios."
