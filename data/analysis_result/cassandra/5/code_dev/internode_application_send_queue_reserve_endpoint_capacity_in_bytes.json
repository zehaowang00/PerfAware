Its primary purpose is to establish default capacity limits for the send queue, ensuring that the application can manage its outbound messaging effectively.\n\n### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Application Reserve Send Queue Capacity**:\n   - The method initializes two key variables: `applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes` and `applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes`. These represent the endpoint-specific and global capacity limits for the application\u2019s send queue.\n\n2. **Default Values**:\n   - If the endpoint capacity is not explicitly set (i.e., it is `null`), the method retrieves a default value from `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes()`. This indicates a dependency on the database configuration for establishing default limits.\n   - Similarly, if the global capacity is not set, it defaults to the value provided by `MessagingService.instance().outboundGlobalReserveLimit`, indicating a reliance on the messaging service for global settings.\n\n3. **Interaction with Other Parts of the System**:\n   - The method concludes by calling `withApplicationReserveSendQueueCapacityInBytes`, passing the determined endpoint and global capacities. This suggests that the method interacts with other components responsible for managing the application\u2019s messaging capabilities, ensuring that the settings are applied correctly.\n\n### Summary:\nOverall, the `withDefaultReserveLimits` method plays a crucial role in establishing the necessary configurations for managing outbound messaging capacity within the application. It ensures that both endpoint-specific and global limits are set, either from existing configurations or by falling back on default values from the database and messaging service, thereby facilitating effective communication within the system."

If this configuration is set too low, it can lead to bottlenecks in message processing, causing delays and increased memory usage as the system attempts to manage overflow. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive resource consumption, affecting overall system performance. The reliance on database and messaging service defaults indicates that improper configuration can lead to substantial performance variations, making it a critical performance-sensitive configuration."
