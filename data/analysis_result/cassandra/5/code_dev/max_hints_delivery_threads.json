A higher number of delivery threads can lead to increased throughput and reduced latency in hint processing, especially under heavy load conditions. Conversely, setting this value too low could result in bottlenecks and delays in hint delivery, affecting overall system responsiveness. Thus, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance due to its role in managing time-intensive operations related to hint dispatching."
