This configuration is accessed through the method `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()`, which retrieves the value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to establish a limit on the size of data batches that can be processed before a failure is triggered. This helps in managing data processing and ensuring that operations do not exceed predefined limits.\n\n#### Key Components\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is a key component that holds the configuration value for the batch size failure threshold. It acts as a centralized source for configuration management, allowing other parts of the system to reference this value consistently.\n\n#### Interactions\nThe `getBatchSizeFailureThreshold()` method serves as an interface for other components of the system to access the batch size failure threshold. By calling this method, other parts of the codebase can obtain the current threshold value, which can be used in various data processing operations to enforce limits and handle potential failures appropriately.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a critical role in defining operational limits for batch processing, ensuring that the system can handle data efficiently while adhering to specified constraints."
