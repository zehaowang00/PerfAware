This configuration is accessed through the system property `cassandra.start_native_transport`. \n\n### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of this configuration is to control the startup of the native transport layer, which is responsible for handling client connections and communication in Cassandra.\n- The method `startClientTransports()` checks the value of `cassandra.start_native_transport`. If the property is set to `true`, or if it is not set (null) and the default behavior from `DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport()` is to start it, the method proceeds to invoke `startNativeTransport()`. This action initializes the native transport service.\n\n### Key Components:\n- **System Property**: The configuration relies on the Java system property `cassandra.start_native_transport` to determine its state.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component provides a default mechanism to decide whether to start the native transport if the system property is not explicitly defined.\n- **StorageService**: After starting the native transport, the method sets the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) readiness state to true via `StorageService.instance.setRpcReady(true)`, indicating that the service is ready to handle incoming requests.\n\n### Interactions:\n- The configuration interacts with the `startNativeTransport()` method, which is responsible for the actual initialization of the transport layer.\n- It also communicates with the `StorageService`, which manages the overall state of the system's services, ensuring that the native transport is ready to accept connections.\n- If the native transport is not started, a log message is generated, informing users that they can enable it through JMX or nodetool, indicating a dependency on external management tools for configuration changes.\n\nIn summary, the `start_native_transport` configuration is essential for controlling the initialization of the native transport service in Cassandra, with dependencies on system properties and interactions with core components like `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StorageService`."
