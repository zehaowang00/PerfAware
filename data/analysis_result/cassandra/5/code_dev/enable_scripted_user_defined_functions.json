This configuration is checked within the `assertUdfsEnabled` method, which validates whether scripted UDFs are permitted based on the settings defined in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` setting is to control the availability of scripted UDFs in the Cassandra database. When set to `true`, it allows users to define and execute functions written in scripting languages, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of data manipulation within the database.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for accessing various configuration settings, including `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions`. It serves as the interface through which the application retrieves the current state of this configuration.\n- **InvalidRequestException**: This exception is thrown when a user attempts to use scripted UDFs while they are disabled, providing immediate feedback on the configuration status.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `assertUdfsEnabled` method interacts with the broader system by enforcing the rules defined in the configuration. If a user attempts to utilize scripted UDFs without the appropriate configuration enabled, the method raises an `InvalidRequestException`, effectively preventing unauthorized or unintended use of this feature. This interaction ensures that the system adheres to the security and operational guidelines set forth in the configuration file, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the database operations.\n\nIn summary, the `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` configuration is essential for controlling the execution of scripted UDFs, ensuring that only authorized and configured functions can be executed, thus maintaining the system's security and operational integrity."
