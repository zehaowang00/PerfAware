It checks if a previously defined timeout exists; if not, it retrieves the timeout value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n- For the **MESSAGING** category, it calls `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`, while for the **STREAMING** category, it calls `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`. This allows for flexibility in handling different types of connections while reusing the same method for both categories.\n\n### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **ConnectionCategory**: An enumeration that categorizes the type of connection (e.g., MESSAGING, STREAMING).\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: A class that contains static methods to fetch configuration values related to internode communication. It acts as the source of truth for the timeout values, ensuring that the system retrieves consistent configuration data.\n\n### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `tcpUserTimeoutInMS` method is likely called by other components that manage or establish connections between nodes. By centralizing the timeout configuration, it ensures that all parts of the system adhere to the same timeout settings based on the connection type.\n- The method `getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()` serves as a direct accessor for the timeout value, reinforcing the modular design of the configuration retrieval process.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a crucial role in managing connection behaviors within the system, ensuring that different types of communication are handled appropriately based on predefined timeout settings."
