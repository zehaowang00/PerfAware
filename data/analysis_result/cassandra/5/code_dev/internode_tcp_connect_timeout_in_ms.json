This configuration is crucial for managing how long the system will wait when attempting to establish a TCP connection before timing out.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Method `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**: This method checks if a local variable `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS` is set. If it is not, it retrieves the value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, specifically calling `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`. This indicates that the method can either use a user-defined or a default system-wide configuration.\n\n2. **Method `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**: This method directly accesses the `DatabaseDescriptor` to fetch the default internode TCP connection timeout value. This establishes `DatabaseDescriptor` as a key component in providing the default configuration value.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor`, which serves as a centralized source for various configuration settings. By relying on `DatabaseDescriptor`, the system ensures consistency in configuration management across different components.\n- The ability to fall back on a default value enhances flexibility, allowing for both custom configurations and a reliable default that can be used if no specific timeout is set.\n\nOverall, the `internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` configuration plays a vital role in defining connection behavior within the system, ensuring that TCP connections between nodes are managed effectively."
