This configuration is defined within the `DatabaseDescriptor` class and influences the behavior of the system when a commit error occurs.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the `commit_failure_policy` is to dictate the system's response to different types of commit failures. It provides a mechanism to handle errors gracefully or to enforce stricter failure responses based on the defined policy. The policy can be set to one of several values: `die`, `stop`, `stop_commit`, or `ignore`, each of which determines a different course of action when a commit error is detected.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for retrieving the current commit failure policy. It acts as a central point for configuration management related to database operations.\n2. **StorageService**: This component is involved in managing the transport layer of the system. Depending on the policy, it may stop transports to prevent further operations when a critical error occurs.\n3. **JVMStabilityInspector**: This utility inspects the throwable errors related to commit logs, providing insights into the nature of the failure.\n4. **Logger**: The logging mechanism captures error messages and additional context, aiding in debugging and operational monitoring.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\n- The `handleCommitError` method utilizes the `commit_failure_policy` to determine the appropriate action when a commit error occurs. It inspects the throwable and executes different code paths based on the policy:\n  - **die**: Terminates the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) immediately.\n  - **stop**: Stops the transport layer and may also lead to JVM termination.\n  - **stop_commit**: Similar to `stop`, but allows for additional handling before termination.\n  - **ignore**: Logs the error but allows the system to continue operating.\n\n- The `inspectCommitLogError` method checks if the daemon setup is complete and reacts accordingly, either logging an error and terminating the JVM or simply terminating the JVM if the policy is set to `die`.\n\nIn summary, the `commit_failure_policy` configuration is essential for defining the system's error handling strategy during commit operations, influencing both the flow of execution and the stability of the JVM in response to errors."
