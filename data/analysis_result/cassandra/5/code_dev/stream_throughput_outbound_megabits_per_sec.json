This configuration is crucial for controlling the rate at which data is transmitted over streams, ensuring that the system adheres to specified bandwidth limits.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component acts as the central configuration manager for the system. It provides methods to retrieve and set the current stream throughput value. The `getStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec()` method fetches the current configuration, while `setStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec(value)` updates it.\n\n2. **StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter**: After updating the throughput value, the `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateThroughput()` method is invoked. This indicates that the rate limiter is responsible for enforcing the new throughput settings, ensuring that the streaming operations comply with the updated configuration.\n\n3. **Logging**: The configuration changes are logged using a logger, which records the new and old throughput values. This logging provides visibility into configuration changes, aiding in debugging and monitoring.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The `setStreamThroughputMbPerSec(int value)` method allows for dynamic adjustment of the stream throughput. It captures the previous value before updating, enabling tracking of changes.\n- The `getStreamThroughputMbPerSec()` method provides a way to retrieve the current throughput setting, facilitating other components in the system to adapt their behavior based on the configured limits.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a vital role in managing data flow within the system, interacting with key components to ensure that streaming operations are conducted within defined parameters."
