This configuration allows for the adjustment of the outbound data transfer rate in megabits per second, enabling system administrators to set and retrieve the desired throughput level.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class serves as the primary interface for accessing and modifying the inter-DC stream throughput value. The methods `getInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec()` and `setInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec(int value)` are utilized to retrieve and update the throughput configuration, respectively.\n\n2. **StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter**: After updating the throughput setting, the `StreamRateLimiter` is invoked to apply the new configuration. This component is responsible for managing the rate of data streams based on the configured throughput, ensuring that the system adheres to the specified limits.\n\n3. **Logging**: The configuration change is logged using a logger to provide visibility into the changes made to the throughput settings. This is useful for tracking adjustments and maintaining an audit trail of configuration changes.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec(int value)` method not only updates the configuration but also triggers an update in the `StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter`, which directly influences how data is streamed between data centers.\n- The `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec()` method allows other components of the system to access the current throughput setting, facilitating dynamic adjustments and checks based on the current configuration.\n- The `calculateInterDCRateInBytes()` method provides a utility to convert the configured megabits per second into bytes, which is essential for internal calculations and ensuring that the system operates within the defined limits.\n\nIn summary, the `inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` configuration plays a critical role in controlling the data flow between data centers, with direct dependencies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` and `StreamManager` components, while also providing logging for configuration changes."
