It is utilized in the initialization of the `PipelineConfigurator`, which is responsible for configuring the network pipeline for handling incoming and outgoing data.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Builder Pattern**: The `Server` class constructor employs a `Builder` object to gather various configuration parameters, including `socket`, `tlsEncryptionPolicy`, and `workerGroup`. This pattern allows for flexible and readable construction of the `Server` instance.\n- **Worker Group**: The configuration determines the type of worker group to be used for handling network events. If a custom `workerGroup` is not provided, the configuration defaults to either an `EpollEventLoopGroup` or a `NioEventLoopGroup`, based on the `useEpoll` flag.\n- **Pipeline Configurator**: The `rpc_keepalive` value is passed to the `PipelineConfigurator`, which uses it to manage the lifecycle of RPC connections. This ensures that connections remain active and are properly maintained, enhancing the reliability of communication between clients and the server.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: The `rpc_keepalive` setting is retrieved from the `DatabaseDescriptor`, indicating that it is likely tied to database connection management and overall server functionality.\n- **Event Notifier**: The `EventNotifier` is registered to track connections, and it interacts with the `PipelineConfigurator` to ensure that the keepalive settings are respected during the lifecycle of RPC calls.\n\nOverall, the `rpc_keepalive` configuration is integral to ensuring stable and persistent connections in the server environment, influencing how the server interacts with clients and manages network resources."
