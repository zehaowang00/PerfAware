            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `counter_cache_size_in_mb` directly influences the memory allocation for the `AutoSavingCache`, which can lead to significant performance variations. A larger cache size can improve data retrieval speeds by reducing the need for frequent disk access, while a smaller size may lead to increased cache misses and slower performance due to more frequent data serialization and saving operations. Therefore, the capacity setting has a substantial impact on memory usage and overall system performance, classifying it as performance sensitive."
