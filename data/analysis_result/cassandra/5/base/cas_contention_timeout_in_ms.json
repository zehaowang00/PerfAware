But then the operation proposing the empty update will not succeed\n                //     either (it will retry or ultimately timeout), and we're actually ok if earlier pending operation gets\n                //     replayed in that case.\n                // Tl;dr, it is safe to skip committing empty updates _as long as_ we also skip replying them below.
