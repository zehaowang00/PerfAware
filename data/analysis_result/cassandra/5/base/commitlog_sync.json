Each synchronization method has different time and resource requirements, which can lead to substantial variations in latency and throughput. For instance, a batch synchronization may improve write performance but could introduce latency during the batch processing period, while a periodic sync may lead to more consistent performance but at the cost of potential data loss in case of a failure.
