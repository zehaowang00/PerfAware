This configuration is particularly relevant for managing the behavior of data transmission and ensuring that it aligns with the server's operational requirements.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The configuration influences the flushing mechanism used by the server when handling native transport. Specifically, it dictates whether the server should utilize a legacy method for flushing data in batches, which can affect how efficiently data is sent over the network.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Pipeline Configurator**:\n   - The `PipelineConfigurator` is a key component that is initialized with several parameters, including the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` setting.

The configuration is part of a broader set of parameters that define the server's behavior, allowing for flexible and adaptable server initialization based on the provided builder settings.\n\nIn summary, the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` configuration is integral to the server's data transmission strategy, with dependencies on various methods and components that collectively define how the server operates in terms of data handling and network communication."

This configurator is responsible for setting up the data processing pipeline for the server, which includes how data is handled and transmitted.\\n\\n2. **Database Descriptor Methods**:\\n   - The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, specifically the `useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher()` method, which retrieves the value of the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` setting from the configuration. This method is essential for determining the flushing strategy employed by the server.\\n\\n3. **RPC Keep-Alive Configuration**:\\n   - The `getRpcKeepAlive()` method retrieves the keep-alive setting for RPC connections, which is another critical aspect of the server's configuration. This setting ensures that connections remain active and can influence how data is flushed and transmitted.\\n\\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\\n- The `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` configuration interacts closely with the server's data handling mechanisms. By influencing the flushing strategy, it affects how data packets are sent, potentially impacting the overall efficiency of data transmission within the server's architecture. The configuration is part of a broader set of parameters that define the server's behavior, allowing for flexible and adaptable server initialization based on the provided builder settings.\\n\\nIn summary, the `native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy` configuration is integral to the server's data transmission strategy, with dependencies on various methods and components that collectively define how the server operates in terms of data handling and network communication.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
