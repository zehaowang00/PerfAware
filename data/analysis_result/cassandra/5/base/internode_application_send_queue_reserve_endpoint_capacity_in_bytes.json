Its primary purpose is to define the reserve capacity allocated to the send queue at the endpoint level, ensuring that the system can handle message transmission efficiently.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n\n1. **Default Initialization**:\n   - The configuration is initialized through the method `withDefaultReserveLimits()`.
