If synchronization lags occur, the system may experience blocking behavior, which can lead to significant delays in processing and overall system throughput. This is particularly critical in high-load scenarios where the frequency of synchronization lags can increase, causing time-intensive operations that affect performance. The potential for blocking operations to accumulate and create bottlenecks underscores the sensitivity of this configuration to system-level performance, making it essential for performance evaluation.\", \"Note\": \"The AI agent has provided suggestions for further performance analysis.\"}"
