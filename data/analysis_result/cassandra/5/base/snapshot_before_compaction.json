Its primary purpose is to determine whether a snapshot of the current state of the data should be taken before the compaction operation begins.\\n\\n#### Functionality and Interactions:\\n\\n- **Configuration Check**: The configuration is evaluated through the method `DatabaseDescriptor.isSnapshotBeforeCompaction()`. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether snapshots should be created prior to compaction.\\n  \\n- **Snapshot Creation**: If the configuration is set to take snapshots, the system invokes `cfs.snapshotWithoutFlush(System.currentTimeMillis() + \\\"-compact-\\\" + cfs.name)`. This method creates a snapshot of the current data state without flushing any pending writes. The snapshot is timestamped and associated with the name of the column family (`cfs.name`).\\n\\n#### Dependencies and Key Components:\\n\\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for managing various configurations, including the snapshot behavior before compaction. It serves as a centralized point for configuration retrieval.\\n\\n- **Column Family Store (CFS)**: The `cfs` object represents the column family being compacted. It is responsible for managing the data structure and operations related to the specific column family.\\n\\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\\n\\nThe snapshot taken before compaction serves as a safety measure, allowing for recovery options in case of issues during the compaction process.

Additionally, the potential for resource contention during high-load scenarios needs to be elaborated with examples or data to strengthen the justification.
