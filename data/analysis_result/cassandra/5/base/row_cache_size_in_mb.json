If not, it defaults to `NopCacheProvider`.\\n   - It attempts to instantiate the specified cache provider class. If it fails, a runtime exception is thrown.\\n   - An `ICache` instance is created using the cache provider, which is then wrapped in an `AutoSavingCache` with a specified serializer.\\n   - The method retrieves the number of keys to save and schedules the saving operation based on the configured save period.\\n\\n### Key Configuration Parameters:\\n- **Row Cache Size**: `DatabaseDescriptor.getRowCacheSizeInMB()`\\n- **Cache Provider Class**: `DatabaseDescriptor.getRowCacheClassName()`\\n- **Keys to Save**: `DatabaseDescriptor.getRowCacheKeysToSave()`\\n- **Save Period**: `DatabaseDescriptor.getRowCacheSavePeriod()` \\n\\nThis information will assist the Performance Agent in analyzing the configuration of the row cache system.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up sensitivity analysis.
