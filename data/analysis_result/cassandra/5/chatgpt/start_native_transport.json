    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how the system handles client connections and data transport. Enabling or disabling this option can lead to significant changes in execution time and resource utilization. When native transport is enabled, it allows for more efficient data communication, which can reduce latency and improve throughput. Conversely, if it is disabled, the system may fall back to a less efficient protocol, leading to increased execution time and higher memory consumption due to the overhead of handling connections in a less optimized manner. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
