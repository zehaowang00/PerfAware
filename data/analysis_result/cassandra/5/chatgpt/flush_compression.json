    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts how data is written to disk. If the compression level is altered, it can lead to significant changes in disk I/O operations, which affects both execution time and memory consumption. Higher compression may reduce disk space usage and improve write performance, but it can also increase CPU usage during compression and decompression processes. Conversely, lower compression may lead to faster write times but increased disk usage and potential performance degradation during read operations. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly affect overall system performance."
