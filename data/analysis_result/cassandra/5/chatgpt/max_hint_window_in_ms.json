    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'max_hint_window_in_ms' in Cassandra determines the maximum duration for which hints are retained for nodes that are temporarily unavailable. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving node failures or network partitions. If the window is too short, hints may be discarded before they can be applied, leading to increased read latencies and potential data inconsistency. Conversely, if the window is too long, it may lead to excessive memory consumption as hints accumulate, affecting overall system throughput and responsiveness. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
