    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'batchlog_replay_throttle_in_kb' in Cassandra controls the rate at which batch log replay occurs. Changes to this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving high write loads or recovery processes. A lower throttle value may lead to increased resource contention and longer execution times during replay, while a higher value can improve throughput but may also lead to increased memory consumption and potential bottlenecks if the system is unable to keep up with the replay rate. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
