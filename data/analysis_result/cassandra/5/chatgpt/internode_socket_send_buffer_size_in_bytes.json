    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the network communication between nodes in a distributed system. A larger send buffer size can improve throughput and reduce the likelihood of packet loss during high-load scenarios, leading to better overall performance. Conversely, a smaller buffer size may result in increased latency and reduced data transfer efficiency, especially when handling large volumes of data. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, making it critical for performance tuning."
