    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how much data can be cached in memory for network operations. A larger cache size can reduce the frequency of disk I/O operations, leading to faster data retrieval and improved overall throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size can result in increased latency and higher memory consumption due to more frequent cache misses, which can significantly affect execution time and system performance, especially under high load conditions."
