    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the timeout duration for write requests to counter columns. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts and retries, significantly increasing the execution time and resource consumption on the system. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to resource contention and delayed responses, affecting overall performance. Therefore, changes to this value can cause notable variations in both execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
