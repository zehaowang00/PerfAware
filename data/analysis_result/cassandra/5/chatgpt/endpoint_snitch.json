    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'endpoint_snitch' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system routes requests and distributes data across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in network latency, data replication efficiency, and load balancing. For instance, if the endpoint snitch is not configured correctly, it may cause uneven distribution of data, resulting in some nodes being overloaded while others are underutilized. This can lead to increased execution times for queries and higher memory consumption due to inefficient resource allocation, ultimately impacting overall system performance."
