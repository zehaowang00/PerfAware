    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is cached in memory versus being read from disk. Enabling file caching can significantly reduce disk I/O operations, leading to faster data access and improved execution times for read-heavy workloads. Conversely, disabling file caching may lead to increased latency and higher memory consumption due to more frequent disk accesses. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
