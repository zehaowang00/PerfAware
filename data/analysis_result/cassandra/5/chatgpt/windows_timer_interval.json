    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the frequency of timer events and scheduling within the system. A lower timer interval can lead to more frequent context switches and increased overhead, which can significantly impact execution time and CPU usage. Conversely, a higher timer interval may reduce the responsiveness of the system, affecting latency and throughput. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it critical for performance tuning."
