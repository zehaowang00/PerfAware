    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' in Cassandra determines the total space allocated for Change Data Capture (CDC) logs. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance because if the allocated space is too low, it may lead to frequent log truncation, which can cause increased I/O operations and delays in data processing. Conversely, if the space is set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption and potentially impact the performance of other operations due to resource contention. Therefore, the value of 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' directly affects both execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
