    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for cache loading operations to complete. A lower timeout may lead to premature cache loading failures, resulting in increased execution times as the system may need to recompute or reload data more frequently. Conversely, a higher timeout can cause delays in response times if the cache is not loaded promptly, affecting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
