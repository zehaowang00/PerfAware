    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the authentication process between nodes in a distributed system. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in the overhead associated with authentication, which can significantly impact the overall latency of inter-node communication. If the authenticator is set to a more complex mechanism, it may increase the time taken for nodes to establish connections, thereby affecting the execution time of read and write operations. Additionally, variations in authentication mechanisms can also lead to differences in resource consumption, such as CPU and memory usage, which can further impact system performance under load."
