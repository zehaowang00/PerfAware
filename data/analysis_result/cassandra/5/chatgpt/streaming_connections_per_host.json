    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of concurrent streaming connections that can be established with each host. A higher value allows for more simultaneous data transfers, which can significantly reduce the time taken for data replication and streaming operations, especially in large clusters or during heavy load scenarios. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks, increased execution time for data operations, and inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
