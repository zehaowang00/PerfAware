    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for caching file data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O operations by allowing more data to be stored in memory, which in turn can lead to faster read and write operations. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased disk access, resulting in higher latency and reduced throughput. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
