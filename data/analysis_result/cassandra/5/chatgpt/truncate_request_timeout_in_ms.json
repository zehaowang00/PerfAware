    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra directly affects the timeout duration for truncate requests. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to premature termination of truncate operations, resulting in incomplete data removal and potential data consistency issues. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause delays in processing other requests, leading to increased execution time and resource consumption. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
