    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_repair_ttl' in Cassandra determines the time-to-live (TTL) for repair tracing information. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance by affecting how long repair data is retained and how often repairs are triggered. If the TTL is set too low, it may lead to frequent repairs, increasing the load on the system and causing notable variations in execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage due to the accumulation of repair data. Therefore, the value change of this configuration can have a direct and significant impact on the overall performance of the Cassandra system."
