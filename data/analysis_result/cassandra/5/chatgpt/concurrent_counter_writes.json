    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly affects how many concurrent writes can be processed for counter columns. A higher value can lead to increased contention and potential performance degradation due to locking mechanisms, while a lower value may limit throughput and increase latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
