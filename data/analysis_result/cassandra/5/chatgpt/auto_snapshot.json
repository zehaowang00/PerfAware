    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how frequently snapshots of the data are taken. When enabled, the system periodically creates snapshots to ensure data durability and recovery. If the frequency of these snapshots is increased or decreased, it can lead to significant variations in disk I/O operations and memory consumption. Frequent snapshots may increase the load on the system, impacting overall performance and execution time, especially during write-heavy operations. Conversely, infrequent snapshots may lead to longer recovery times and potential data loss in case of failures. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
