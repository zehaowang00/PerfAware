    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_optimization_strategy' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to and read from disk, which can significantly affect I/O performance. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, particularly under heavy load or when dealing with large datasets. For instance, selecting a more aggressive optimization strategy may reduce latency and improve throughput, while a less optimized strategy could result in increased disk I/O and slower response times. Therefore, its value change can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
