    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching counter data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk reads required for counter operations, leading to improved execution times and lower latency. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk I/O, which can degrade performance, especially under high load conditions. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
