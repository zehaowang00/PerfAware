    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the counter cache is flushed to disk. A shorter save period can lead to more frequent disk writes, which may increase I/O operations and impact overall system performance, especially under high write loads. Conversely, a longer save period may reduce I/O but could lead to increased memory consumption if the cache becomes too large. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
