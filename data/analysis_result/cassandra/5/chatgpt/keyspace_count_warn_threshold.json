    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of keyspaces that can be created before a warning is issued. A change in this threshold can significantly impact system performance, as having too many keyspaces can lead to increased overhead in resource management, memory consumption, and potential degradation in query performance. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to unnecessary warnings and administrative overhead, while setting it too high can result in performance issues due to resource contention and inefficient data access patterns. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization."
