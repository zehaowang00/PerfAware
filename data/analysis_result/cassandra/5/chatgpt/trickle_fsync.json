    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync' configuration in Cassandra controls how often data is flushed to disk. Adjusting this value can significantly impact I/O performance, as a lower value may lead to more frequent disk writes, increasing execution time and potentially causing higher memory consumption due to buffering. Conversely, a higher value may reduce the frequency of writes, which can improve performance but risks data loss in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to 'trickle_fsync' can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
