    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra controls the duration that a connection can remain idle before being closed. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios with high connection churn or varying workloads. If the timeout is set too low, it may lead to frequent disconnections and reconnections, increasing latency and overhead. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to resource exhaustion due to idle connections consuming system resources, potentially degrading overall performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
