    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value can lead to quicker detection of failed connections, which can improve the responsiveness of the system under certain failure conditions. Conversely, a higher timeout value may result in longer wait times for operations to fail, potentially leading to increased latency and resource consumption. Changes in this configuration can significantly impact the overall performance, especially in high-load scenarios or during network partitions, making it critical for tuning performance in distributed environments."
