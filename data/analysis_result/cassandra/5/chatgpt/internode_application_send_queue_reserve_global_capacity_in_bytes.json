    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' directly influences the capacity of the send queue used for inter-node communication in Cassandra. A change in this value can significantly affect the throughput and latency of data transmission between nodes. If the capacity is too low, it can lead to increased message queuing, resulting in higher execution times and potential bottlenecks in data processing. Conversely, if the capacity is set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
