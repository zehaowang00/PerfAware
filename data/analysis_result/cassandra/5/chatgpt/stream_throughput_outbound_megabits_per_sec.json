    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' directly influences the rate at which data is streamed out of the Cassandra nodes. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in network bandwidth utilization, which in turn affects the overall performance of data replication and read/write operations. If set too low, it can throttle the throughput, causing increased latency and slower response times for client requests. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to network congestion and packet loss, adversely affecting system stability and performance. Therefore, this configuration is critical for maintaining optimal performance levels in a distributed database environment."
