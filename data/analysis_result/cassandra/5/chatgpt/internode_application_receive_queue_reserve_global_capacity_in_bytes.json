    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the capacity of the receive queue for internode communication. A change in this value can lead to variations in how much data can be buffered during peak loads, affecting the overall throughput and latency of data processing. If the capacity is set too low, it may result in dropped messages or increased latency due to backpressure, while a higher capacity can improve performance by allowing more data to be handled concurrently. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can significantly impact system performance metrics such as execution time and memory consumption."
