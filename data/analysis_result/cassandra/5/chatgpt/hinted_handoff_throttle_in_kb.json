    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the rate at which hinted handoffs are processed. If this value is set too low, it can lead to increased latency in write operations, as nodes may spend more time waiting to process hints, thus affecting overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive memory consumption and network traffic, potentially overwhelming the system. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
