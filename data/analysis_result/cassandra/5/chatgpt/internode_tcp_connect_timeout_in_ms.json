    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the time taken for nodes in the cluster to establish TCP connections with each other. A lower timeout value can lead to quicker failure detection and retries, which can significantly impact overall system performance, especially in scenarios with network latency or transient failures. Conversely, a higher timeout value may delay failure detection, potentially leading to longer execution times for operations that depend on inter-node communication. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and overall system responsiveness."
