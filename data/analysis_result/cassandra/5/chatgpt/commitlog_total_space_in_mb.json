    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the amount of disk space allocated for commit logs. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in system performance. If the allocated space is too low, it may result in frequent flushing of commit logs, which can increase write latency and negatively impact overall throughput. Conversely, allocating excessive space may lead to inefficient disk usage and increased garbage collection times. Therefore, the size of the commit log directly affects both execution time and memory consumption, making it a critical configuration for performance tuning."
