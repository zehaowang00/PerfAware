    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of cached rows that can be processed before a failure is triggered. A change in this threshold can significantly impact system performance, as it directly affects memory usage and the efficiency of data retrieval operations. If set too low, it may lead to frequent cache misses and increased disk I/O, resulting in longer execution times. Conversely, if set too high, it could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing the system to run out of memory and degrade performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable fluctuations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
