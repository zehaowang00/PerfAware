    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' in Cassandra directly influences how SSTables are managed in memory. A change in this value can significantly affect the amount of memory allocated for preemptively opening SSTables, which in turn impacts read and write performance. If the interval is set too low, it may lead to increased disk I/O as SSTables are opened more frequently, resulting in longer execution times for read operations. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors, affecting overall system stability and performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in both execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
