    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. A change in this setting can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of write latency and durability guarantees. For example, setting it to 'batch' can improve write performance by reducing the number of disk I/O operations, while setting it to 'periodic' may lead to increased latency and potential data loss in the event of a crash. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly affect execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
