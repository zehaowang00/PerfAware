    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a response from a request before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent timeouts, resulting in increased retries and potentially higher resource consumption, while a higher timeout can delay the detection of issues, affecting overall system responsiveness. Changes in this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
