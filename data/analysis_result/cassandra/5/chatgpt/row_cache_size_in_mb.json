    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching rows in memory. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk reads required for frequently accessed data, leading to lower execution times and improved throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk I/O, higher latency, and more frequent cache misses, which can degrade performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
