    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_flush_writers' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of concurrent threads responsible for flushing memtables to disk. Increasing this value can significantly enhance write performance by allowing more memtables to be flushed simultaneously, thus reducing write latency and improving overall throughput. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to increased memory usage and longer write times, as memtables accumulate and require more time to flush. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
