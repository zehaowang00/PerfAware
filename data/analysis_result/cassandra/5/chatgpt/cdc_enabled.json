    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cdc_enabled' configuration in Cassandra controls whether Change Data Capture (CDC) is active. Enabling CDC can significantly impact system performance because it introduces additional overhead for writing data, as changes must be logged for later retrieval. This can lead to increased disk I/O, higher memory usage, and longer execution times for write operations. Conversely, disabling CDC can reduce resource consumption and improve write performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
