    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging slow queries. If this value is set too high, it may lead to an increased number of queries being logged, which can consume additional I/O and storage resources, thereby affecting overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too low may result in important queries being missed, impacting performance tuning efforts. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and resource consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
