    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling this feature can significantly impact the way data is tracked and managed during range reads. When this option is enabled, the system must perform additional checks and maintain metadata related to repaired data, which can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption. This is particularly important in scenarios with large datasets or high read loads, where the overhead of managing repaired data can affect overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization."
