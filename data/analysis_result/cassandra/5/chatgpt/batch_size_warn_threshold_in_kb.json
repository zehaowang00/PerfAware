    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles batch operations. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to excessive warnings and potentially force the system to break down larger batches into smaller ones, which can increase the execution time and overhead associated with processing multiple smaller batches instead of fewer larger ones. Conversely, setting it too high may result in inefficient memory usage and increased latency due to larger batch sizes being processed, which can lead to performance degradation. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
