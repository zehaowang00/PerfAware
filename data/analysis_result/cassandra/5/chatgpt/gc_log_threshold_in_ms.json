    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging garbage collection events. Changes to this threshold can significantly impact system performance, as it affects how often garbage collection events are logged and subsequently analyzed. A lower threshold may lead to more frequent logging, which can increase I/O operations and CPU usage, potentially causing notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may result in less frequent logging, which could obscure performance issues related to garbage collection. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct influence on the monitoring and optimization of memory management within the system."
