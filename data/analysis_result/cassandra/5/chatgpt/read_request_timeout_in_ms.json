    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a read request to complete before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to premature timeouts, causing increased error rates and potentially higher resource consumption due to repeated retries. Conversely, a higher timeout can lead to longer wait times for users and increased latency in response times. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, including execution time and user experience."
