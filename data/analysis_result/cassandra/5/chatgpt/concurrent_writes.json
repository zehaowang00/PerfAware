    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of write operations that can be processed simultaneously. A higher value allows more concurrent writes, which can lead to increased throughput and reduced write latency, especially under heavy load. Conversely, setting this value too low can create bottlenecks, resulting in significant delays and increased resource consumption. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
