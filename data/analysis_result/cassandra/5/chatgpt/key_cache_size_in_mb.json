    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching keys. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk accesses required for read operations, thereby improving execution time and overall system throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased disk I/O, resulting in longer execution times and higher latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on performance, making it performance-sensitive."
