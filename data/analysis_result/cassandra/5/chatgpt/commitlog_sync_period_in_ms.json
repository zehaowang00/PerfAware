    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. A shorter sync period can lead to increased disk I/O, which may improve data durability and reduce the risk of data loss in case of a crash, but it can also increase latency and reduce overall throughput due to the overhead of more frequent disk operations. Conversely, a longer sync period can enhance performance by reducing the number of disk writes, but it increases the risk of data loss. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
