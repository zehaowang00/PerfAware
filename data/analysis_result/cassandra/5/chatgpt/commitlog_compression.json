    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the I/O performance and disk space utilization of the system. Enabling or disabling commit log compression can lead to significant variations in the amount of data written to disk, which in turn affects the execution time of write operations. When compression is enabled, the system can reduce the size of the commit logs, leading to less disk I/O and faster write performance. Conversely, if compression is disabled, the larger commit logs can result in increased I/O operations, potentially slowing down the overall performance of the database under heavy write loads. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on system performance metrics such as execution time and resource consumption."
