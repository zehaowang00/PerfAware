    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in Cassandra directly influences how tokens are allocated for data distribution across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this setting can significantly impact the load balancing of data, which in turn affects read and write performance. If the allocation is not optimal, it can lead to uneven data distribution, resulting in some nodes being overloaded while others are underutilized. This can cause notable variations in execution time and increase latency for read and write operations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
