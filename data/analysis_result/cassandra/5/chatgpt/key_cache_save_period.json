    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the key cache is saved to disk. A shorter save period can lead to more frequent disk writes, which may increase I/O operations and impact overall system performance, especially under heavy load. Conversely, a longer save period may reduce I/O but could lead to increased memory consumption if the cache is not flushed regularly. Changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
