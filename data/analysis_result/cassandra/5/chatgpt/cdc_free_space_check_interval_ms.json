    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the system checks the available free space for Change Data Capture (CDC) logs. A shorter interval can lead to more frequent checks, which may increase CPU usage and I/O operations, potentially impacting overall system performance. Conversely, a longer interval may delay the cleanup of CDC logs, leading to increased disk space usage and possible performance degradation due to insufficient storage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
