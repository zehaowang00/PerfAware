    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration in Cassandra controls the number of concurrent threads that can build materialized views. A higher number of concurrent builders can lead to increased resource utilization, such as CPU and memory, which can significantly impact overall system performance. If this value is set too high, it may cause contention for resources, leading to increased execution time and potential degradation in performance for other operations. Conversely, setting it too low may result in underutilization of available resources, prolonging the time taken to build views. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
