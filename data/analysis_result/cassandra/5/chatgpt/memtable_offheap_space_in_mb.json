    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. A change in this configuration can significantly impact system performance by affecting write throughput and read latency. If the off-heap space is too low, it can lead to increased disk I/O as memtables are flushed to disk more frequently, resulting in longer execution times and higher latency. Conversely, allocating too much memory can lead to inefficient memory usage and potential garbage collection issues. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
