    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to commit failures, which can significantly impact the overall performance and reliability of the database. If this policy is set to a more lenient option, it may lead to increased latency during write operations, as the system may attempt retries or allow for temporary inconsistencies. Conversely, a stricter policy could result in immediate failures, affecting throughput and potentially leading to higher resource consumption if the system is forced to handle more error recovery processes. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
