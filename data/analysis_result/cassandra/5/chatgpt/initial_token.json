    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the distribution of data across the cluster. A change in this value can lead to uneven data distribution, which may result in hotspots, increased latency, and variations in load across nodes. This can significantly affect the overall execution time of queries and the efficiency of resource utilization, thereby impacting system performance."
