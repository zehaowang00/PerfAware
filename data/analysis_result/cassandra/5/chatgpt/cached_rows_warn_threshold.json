    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for the number of cached rows before a warning is issued. Adjusting this value can significantly impact the performance of read operations, as it influences how much data is cached in memory versus how much is read from disk. A lower threshold may lead to more frequent warnings and potentially more cache misses, resulting in increased disk I/O and longer execution times for queries. Conversely, a higher threshold may improve performance by allowing more data to be cached, reducing the need for disk access. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
