    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration in Cassandra determines how memory is allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used to write data before it is flushed to disk. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact memory usage and garbage collection behavior, leading to variations in execution time and overall system performance. For instance, using a different allocation type may result in more efficient memory usage or reduced fragmentation, directly affecting read and write latencies. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
