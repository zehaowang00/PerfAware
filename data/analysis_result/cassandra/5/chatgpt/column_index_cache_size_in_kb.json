    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching column indexes. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O by allowing more index data to be stored in memory, leading to faster query execution times. Conversely, a smaller cache size can result in increased disk access, which can degrade performance, especially for read-heavy workloads. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
