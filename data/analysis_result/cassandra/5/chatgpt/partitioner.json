    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how data is distributed across nodes in the cluster. A change in the partitioner can lead to significant variations in data locality, which affects read and write performance. For instance, using a different partitioning strategy may result in uneven data distribution, causing some nodes to become hotspots while others remain underutilized. This imbalance can lead to increased latency and higher resource consumption, impacting overall system performance. Additionally, the choice of partitioner can affect how efficiently Cassandra handles data replication and consistency, further influencing execution time and memory usage."
