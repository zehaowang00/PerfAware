    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines how much data can be held in memory before triggering a cleanup of memtables. A change in this threshold can significantly impact memory consumption and garbage collection behavior, leading to variations in execution time. If set too high, it can lead to increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors, while too low a value can cause frequent flushes to disk, degrading write performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable effect on the overall performance of the system."
