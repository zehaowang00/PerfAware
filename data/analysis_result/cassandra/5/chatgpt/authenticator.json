    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the authentication process for users and applications accessing the database. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, especially under high load conditions, as different authentication mechanisms may have different performance characteristics. For instance, using a more complex authentication method may increase latency and resource consumption, impacting overall system performance. Additionally, improper configuration can lead to bottlenecks in user access, further affecting the throughput and responsiveness of the database system."
