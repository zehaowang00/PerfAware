    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_validations' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of simultaneous validation operations that can occur. A higher value can lead to increased CPU and memory usage, potentially resulting in contention for resources and longer execution times if the system becomes overloaded. Conversely, a lower value may reduce resource consumption but could lead to slower validation processes, impacting overall throughput and latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
