    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'trickle_fsync_interval_in_kb' in Cassandra directly influences how frequently data is flushed to disk. A lower value can lead to more frequent disk writes, which may increase I/O operations and potentially degrade performance due to higher latency. Conversely, a higher value may reduce the frequency of flushes, leading to increased memory usage and possibly higher risks of data loss during crashes. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
