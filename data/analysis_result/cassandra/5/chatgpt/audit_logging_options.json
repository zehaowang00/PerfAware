    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact system performance because it controls the logging of audit events. If enabled or set to a verbose level, it can lead to increased I/O operations and higher memory usage due to the additional data being processed and stored. This can result in notable variations in execution time, especially under high load or when handling large volumes of transactions, as the system may spend more time writing logs rather than processing requests."
