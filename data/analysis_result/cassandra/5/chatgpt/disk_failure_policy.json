    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to disk failures, which can significantly impact data availability and consistency. A change in this policy can lead to variations in execution time, particularly during write operations, as the system may need to handle retries or fallback mechanisms differently. Additionally, it can affect memory consumption if the system has to allocate more resources to manage data integrity and recovery processes. Therefore, altering this configuration can lead to notable changes in overall system performance."
