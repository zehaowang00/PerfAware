    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the number of keyspaces that can be managed efficiently within the system. A lower threshold may lead to frequent warnings and potential performance degradation as the system struggles to manage an increasing number of keyspaces, impacting execution time and resource utilization. Conversely, a higher threshold may allow for better resource allocation and performance but could risk overloading the system if not monitored properly. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect overall system performance and resource management."
