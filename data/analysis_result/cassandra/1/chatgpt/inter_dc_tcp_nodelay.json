    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the TCP behavior between data centers. Enabling TCP_NODELAY minimizes latency by disabling Nagle's algorithm, which can lead to faster message delivery. This is crucial in a distributed system like Cassandra, where inter-data center communication can significantly affect overall performance. Changes to this setting can lead to notable variations in execution time and network throughput, especially in scenarios with high-frequency updates or low-latency requirements. Therefore, adjusting this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance."
