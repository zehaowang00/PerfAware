    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' in Cassandra controls the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established from a single IP address to the database. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, especially in high-load scenarios where multiple clients are connecting simultaneously. If the limit is set too low, it can lead to connection throttling, increased latency, and reduced throughput as clients may experience delays in establishing connections. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to resource exhaustion, increased memory usage, and potential degradation of performance due to context switching and connection management overhead. Therefore, any adjustment to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
