    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of cached rows that can be processed before a failure is triggered. A change in this threshold can significantly impact the performance of read operations, as it directly influences how many rows are retrieved from the cache versus having to access the disk. Lowering the threshold may lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times, while raising it could improve performance by reducing the frequency of cache misses. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
