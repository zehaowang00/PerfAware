    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'prepared_statements_cache_size_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the caching behavior of prepared statements. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the execution time of queries that utilize prepared statements by minimizing the need to recompile them. Conversely, a smaller cache size can lead to increased memory consumption and higher latency due to frequent cache misses, resulting in the need to re-prepare statements. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
