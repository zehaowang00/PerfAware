    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the overhead associated with data encryption and decryption processes. When enabled, encryption can significantly increase CPU usage and latency due to the additional computational resources required for encrypting data before it is written to disk and decrypting it when it is read. Variations in the configuration values, such as the choice of encryption algorithms or key sizes, can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource consumption, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial effect on the performance of the Cassandra database."
