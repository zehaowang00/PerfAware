    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' configuration in Cassandra directly impacts the duration for which the system waits for cache loading operations to complete. A lower timeout may lead to premature failures in cache loading, resulting in increased disk I/O and slower query responses due to cache misses. Conversely, a higher timeout can delay the detection of issues, potentially leading to longer wait times for users. Therefore, variations in this configuration can significantly affect execution time and overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
