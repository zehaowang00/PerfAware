    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines how long the system will wait for a request to complete before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to increased failure rates for requests, especially under high load or when the system is experiencing latency. This can cause significant variations in execution time and can lead to increased resource consumption as the system may need to retry failed requests. Conversely, a higher timeout value can lead to longer wait times for clients, impacting overall system responsiveness. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a direct and significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
