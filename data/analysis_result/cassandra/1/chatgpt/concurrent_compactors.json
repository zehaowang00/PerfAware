    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of concurrent compaction operations that can occur. Increasing this value allows more compaction processes to run simultaneously, which can lead to improved throughput and reduced latency during write operations. Conversely, setting this value too low can cause compaction to become a bottleneck, leading to increased disk I/O and higher execution times for write and read operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
