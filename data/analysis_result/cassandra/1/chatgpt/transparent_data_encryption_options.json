    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or modifying encryption settings can significantly impact I/O performance and CPU utilization. Encryption requires additional processing overhead for both encrypting and decrypting data, which can lead to increased execution time for read and write operations. Furthermore, the choice of encryption algorithms and key management strategies can affect memory consumption and overall system throughput, making this configuration critical for performance tuning in environments where data security is a priority."
