    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly affects how much data can be stored in memory for quick access. A larger row cache can significantly reduce the number of disk reads required for frequently accessed rows, leading to lower execution times and improved throughput. Conversely, a smaller cache may lead to increased disk I/O, higher latency, and greater memory consumption due to cache misses. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
