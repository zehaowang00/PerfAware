    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' in Cassandra directly influences how frequently the commit log is synchronized to disk. If this value is increased, it can lead to longer periods of time where data is not safely written to disk, potentially increasing the risk of data loss in the event of a failure. Additionally, a higher lag can result in increased memory consumption as more data accumulates in memory before being flushed to disk, which can also affect overall system performance and responsiveness. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
