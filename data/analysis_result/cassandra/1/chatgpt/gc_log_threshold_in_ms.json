    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging garbage collection events. Changes to this threshold can significantly impact the performance of the system, as it affects how often garbage collection logs are generated and how the system manages memory. A lower threshold may lead to more frequent logging, which can introduce overhead and increase execution time due to the additional I/O operations for writing logs. Conversely, a higher threshold may reduce logging frequency but could lead to less visibility into memory management issues, potentially resulting in performance degradation if garbage collection is not effectively monitored. Therefore, this configuration is performance-sensitive as its value directly influences both memory consumption and execution time."
