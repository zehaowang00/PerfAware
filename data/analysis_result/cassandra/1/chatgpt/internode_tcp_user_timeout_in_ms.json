    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent disconnections and reconnections, which can increase latency and negatively impact overall throughput. Conversely, a higher timeout may delay the detection of failed nodes, potentially leading to slower recovery times and increased resource consumption. Changes in this configuration can significantly affect both execution time and memory consumption, making it critical for performance tuning in distributed environments."
