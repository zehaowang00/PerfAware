    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the number of concurrent streaming connections that can be established with each host during data replication and repair processes. A higher value allows for more simultaneous connections, which can significantly reduce the time taken for data streaming operations, thereby impacting overall system performance. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to bottlenecks, increased execution time for data transfers, and higher memory consumption due to queued requests. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
