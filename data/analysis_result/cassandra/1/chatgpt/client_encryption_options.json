    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the encryption and decryption processes for data transmitted between clients and the server. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance due to variations in CPU usage, latency, and throughput. For instance, enabling stronger encryption algorithms may increase execution time and memory consumption due to the additional computational overhead required for encryption operations. Conversely, disabling encryption can lead to reduced resource utilization but may expose the system to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, any modification to 'client_encryption_options' can lead to notable variations in system performance metrics."
