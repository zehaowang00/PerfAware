    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections' in Cassandra directly influences the number of simultaneous connections that can be handled by the server. A higher number of concurrent connections can lead to increased resource utilization, such as CPU and memory consumption, which can significantly affect overall system performance. If this value is set too low, it can result in connection throttling, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput for client requests. Conversely, setting it too high may overwhelm the system resources, causing performance degradation. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
