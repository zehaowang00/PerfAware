    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for logging slow queries. If this value is set too low, it may lead to excessive logging of queries that are not significantly impacting performance, resulting in increased I/O operations and memory usage for log management. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause the system to miss logging important slow queries that could indicate performance bottlenecks. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect the system's performance by altering the logging behavior, which in turn can impact query execution times and overall resource utilization."
