    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the authentication process for client connections. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time, particularly under high load conditions where multiple authentication requests are processed simultaneously. An inefficient authentication mechanism can increase latency and resource consumption, affecting overall system performance and responsiveness. Additionally, different authentication methods may have varying computational overhead, which can significantly impact memory usage and CPU cycles, further emphasizing the sensitivity of this configuration."
