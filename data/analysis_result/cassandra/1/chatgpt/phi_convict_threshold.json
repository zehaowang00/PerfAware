    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how quickly the system identifies and handles potentially unresponsive nodes in the cluster. A lower threshold can lead to aggressive conviction of nodes, which may cause unnecessary removals and increased load on the remaining nodes, while a higher threshold may delay the detection of issues, leading to prolonged performance degradation. Changes in this configuration can significantly impact the overall system performance, including execution time for read/write operations and memory consumption due to the handling of unresponsive nodes."
