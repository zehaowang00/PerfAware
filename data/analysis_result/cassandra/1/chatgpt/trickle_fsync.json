    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'trickle_fsync' configuration in Cassandra controls the frequency of flushing data to disk. A change in this setting can significantly impact the performance of write operations. If set too low, it can lead to increased disk I/O, causing higher latency and reduced throughput during heavy write loads. Conversely, setting it too high may delay data persistence, risking data loss in the event of a crash. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
