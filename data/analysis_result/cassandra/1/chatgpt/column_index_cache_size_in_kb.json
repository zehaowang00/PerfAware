    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how much index data can be cached in memory. A larger cache size can significantly reduce the number of disk accesses required during read operations, leading to faster execution times and lower latency. Conversely, a smaller cache size may result in increased disk I/O, which can degrade performance, especially under heavy load or with large datasets. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
