    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in Cassandra determines the maximum size of frames that can be sent over the native transport protocol. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of network throughput and memory consumption. If the frame size is set too low, it may lead to increased overhead due to more frequent frame transmissions, resulting in higher latency and reduced throughput. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors, especially under heavy load. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
