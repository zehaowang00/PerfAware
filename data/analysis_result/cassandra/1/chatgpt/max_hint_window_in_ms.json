    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum time window for which hints are stored for failed nodes. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance, particularly in scenarios involving node failures and recovery. If the window is set too low, hints may be discarded before they can be applied, leading to increased read latencies and potential data inconsistencies. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption as more hints are retained, which can also affect overall system throughput and response times. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly influence execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
