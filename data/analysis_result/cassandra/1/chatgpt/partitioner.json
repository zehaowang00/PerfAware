    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration in Cassandra is critical for determining how data is distributed across nodes in a cluster. Changes to the partitioner can significantly impact data locality, load balancing, and query performance. A different partitioning strategy can lead to uneven data distribution, which may cause some nodes to become hotspots, resulting in increased latency and resource consumption. Additionally, it affects how data is read and written, influencing overall system throughput and response times. Therefore, variations in the partitioner configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
