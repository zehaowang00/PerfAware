    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in Cassandra is critical for managing user roles and permissions. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact the performance of access control and authorization processes. If the role management settings are misconfigured or optimized improperly, it could lead to increased latency in query execution times, especially in environments with high concurrency or large datasets. Additionally, the overhead associated with role validation during read and write operations can vary greatly depending on the configuration, affecting overall system throughput and resource utilization."
