    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the amount of disk I/O and CPU usage during write operations. Enabling compression can reduce the size of the commit log, leading to less disk space usage and potentially faster write times due to reduced I/O. However, it also introduces additional CPU overhead for compressing and decompressing the data. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time and resource consumption, especially under heavy write loads, making it a critical parameter for performance tuning."
