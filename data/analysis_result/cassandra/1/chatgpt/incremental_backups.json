    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this option can significantly impact the system's I/O performance and overall resource utilization. When incremental backups are enabled, the system performs additional write operations to store the incremental data, which can lead to increased disk I/O and potentially affect the execution time of other operations. Conversely, disabling this feature may reduce the backup overhead but can increase the risk of data loss and recovery time in the event of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
