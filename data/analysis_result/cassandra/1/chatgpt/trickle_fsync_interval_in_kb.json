    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'trickle_fsync_interval_in_kb' in Cassandra directly influences how frequently data is flushed to disk. A change in this value can significantly impact the execution time of write operations and the overall throughput of the system. If the interval is set too low, it may lead to increased I/O operations, causing higher latency and reduced performance. Conversely, setting it too high may risk data loss in case of a failure, but can improve write performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in both execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
