    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the authentication mechanism between nodes in a cluster. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in the time taken for nodes to authenticate each other, impacting the overall latency of inter-node communication. If the authentication process is slower due to a less efficient configuration, it can cause delays in data replication and query processing, significantly affecting the system's throughput and response times. Additionally, if the configuration leads to increased resource consumption (e.g., CPU or memory usage) during authentication, it can further degrade performance under load, making it a critical aspect of performance tuning in distributed environments."
