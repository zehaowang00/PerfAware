    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how long the system waits for a Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operation to complete before timing out. If this timeout value is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts, resulting in increased retries and higher overall execution time for operations that depend on CAS. Conversely, if the timeout is set too high, it can lead to resource contention and increased memory consumption as operations wait longer than necessary. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact both execution time and resource utilization, making it a critical parameter for performance tuning."
