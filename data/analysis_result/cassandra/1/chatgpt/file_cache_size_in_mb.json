    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching file data. A larger cache size can significantly reduce disk I/O operations by allowing more data to be stored in memory, leading to faster read and write operations. Conversely, a smaller cache size can increase the frequency of disk accesses, resulting in higher latency and lower throughput. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and overall system performance."
