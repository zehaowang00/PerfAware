    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the frequency of timer events and the granularity of time-based operations. Changes to this interval can lead to significant variations in how often tasks are scheduled and executed, affecting overall system performance. A shorter timer interval may increase the responsiveness of the system but can also lead to higher CPU usage and context switching, while a longer interval may reduce CPU load but could introduce latency in processing requests. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can notably impact execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
