    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of data transmitted between nodes. Enabling compression reduces the size of the data being sent, which can significantly decrease network bandwidth usage and improve overall throughput. Conversely, disabling it may lead to increased data transfer sizes, resulting in higher latency and increased execution time for read and write operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
