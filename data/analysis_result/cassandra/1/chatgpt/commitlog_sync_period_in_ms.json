    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is synchronized to disk. A shorter sync period can lead to increased durability and reduced data loss in the event of a crash, but it also increases the frequency of disk I/O operations, which can significantly impact system performance. Conversely, a longer sync period can improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations, but it increases the risk of data loss. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and overall system throughput, making it performance-sensitive."
