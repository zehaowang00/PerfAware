    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in Cassandra can significantly impact system performance because it controls the level and frequency of logging operations. If set to a high verbosity level, it can lead to increased I/O operations and higher disk usage, which may slow down the overall system performance due to additional overhead in writing logs. Conversely, a lower verbosity level may reduce the performance impact but could limit the visibility into system operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption."
