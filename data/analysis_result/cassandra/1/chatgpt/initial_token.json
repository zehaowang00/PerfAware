    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in Cassandra determines the starting point for data partitioning across nodes in a cluster. A change in this value can lead to significant variations in data distribution, which directly impacts read and write performance. If the initial token is not set optimally, it can result in uneven data distribution, causing some nodes to become hotspots while others remain underutilized. This imbalance can lead to increased latency and reduced throughput, making the configuration highly sensitive to performance variations."
