    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra determines the amount of memory allocated for repair sessions. A significant change in this value can lead to variations in memory consumption during repair operations, which are critical for maintaining data consistency and integrity in distributed systems. If the allocated space is too low, it can result in increased execution time due to frequent garbage collection or out-of-memory errors, thereby impacting overall system performance. Conversely, allocating too much space may lead to inefficient memory usage, affecting other operations. Therefore, this configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly influences the efficiency and speed of repair processes."
