    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'counter_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the counter cache is flushed to disk. A shorter save period can lead to more frequent writes, which may increase disk I/O and impact overall system performance, especially under high write loads. Conversely, a longer save period may result in increased memory usage and potential data loss in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
