    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the timeout duration for truncate requests. If this value is set too low, it may lead to premature timeouts during operations, causing increased execution time for truncate requests and potentially affecting overall system performance due to retries or failures. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to resource contention and delays in processing other requests, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and system responsiveness."
