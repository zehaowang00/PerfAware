    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling diagnostic events can significantly increase the amount of logging and monitoring data generated by the system. This can lead to increased I/O operations, higher memory usage for storing logs, and potential delays in processing due to the overhead of collecting and managing diagnostic data. Consequently, changes to this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource consumption, impacting overall system performance."
