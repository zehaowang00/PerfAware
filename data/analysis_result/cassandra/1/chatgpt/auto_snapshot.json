    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's I/O operations and disk usage. When enabled, automatic snapshots can lead to increased disk activity, which may affect read and write latencies, especially during peak loads. If the frequency or size of snapshots is altered, it can significantly change the amount of data being processed and stored, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
