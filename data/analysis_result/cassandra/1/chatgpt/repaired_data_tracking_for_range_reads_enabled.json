    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this feature can significantly impact the efficiency of read operations. When enabled, the system needs to track and manage additional metadata related to data repairs, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential overhead during range reads. This can result in notable variations in execution time for read queries, especially in large datasets or under heavy load conditions. Conversely, disabling this feature may reduce memory consumption and improve read performance, but at the risk of potentially reading stale or inconsistent data. Therefore, changes to this configuration directly influence system performance."
