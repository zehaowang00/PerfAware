    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles disk failures, which can significantly impact data availability and recovery times. A change in this policy can lead to variations in execution time during read/write operations, especially under failure scenarios. For instance, a more aggressive policy may result in faster recovery but could increase the load on the system, affecting overall performance. Conversely, a less aggressive policy may lead to longer downtimes, impacting the system's responsiveness and throughput. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can have notable implications on system performance."
