    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_sync' configuration in Cassandra determines how frequently the commit log is flushed to disk. A change in this configuration can significantly impact system performance, particularly in terms of write latency and durability guarantees. If set to a more aggressive sync policy (e.g., 'batch'), it can lead to lower write latencies but may increase the risk of data loss during failures. Conversely, a less aggressive sync policy (e.g., 'periodic') can enhance durability but may introduce higher write latencies. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly affect execution time and overall system throughput, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
