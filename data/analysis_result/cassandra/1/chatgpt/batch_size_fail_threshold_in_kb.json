    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum size of a batch operation that can be processed before it is considered to have failed. A change in this threshold can significantly impact system performance, as larger batch sizes can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times if the system attempts to process batches that exceed the optimal size for the available resources. Conversely, setting the threshold too low may lead to frequent failures and retries, which can degrade performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
