    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how long the system will wait for a write operation to complete before timing out. A shorter timeout may lead to increased failure rates for write operations, causing retries and potentially overwhelming the system, which can significantly increase execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, a longer timeout may delay the detection of issues, leading to inefficient resource utilization. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance and responsiveness."
