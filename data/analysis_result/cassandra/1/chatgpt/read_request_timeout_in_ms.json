    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how long the system waits for a read request to complete before timing out. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent timeouts, especially under high load or with slow queries, resulting in increased error rates and potential performance degradation. Conversely, a higher timeout may allow slow queries to complete but can lead to resource contention and increased latency for subsequent requests. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and overall system performance."
