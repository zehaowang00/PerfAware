    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_large_partition_warning_threshold_mb' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the system handles large partitions during compaction. If the threshold is set too low, it may lead to frequent warnings and potentially trigger unnecessary compaction operations, which can increase execution time and CPU usage. Conversely, if set too high, it may allow excessively large partitions to accumulate, resulting in increased memory consumption and degraded performance during read and write operations. Thus, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
