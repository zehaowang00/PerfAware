    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_save_period' configuration in Cassandra determines how often the key cache is saved to disk. A shorter save period can lead to increased disk I/O and potentially higher latency during write operations, while a longer save period may result in more data being lost in the event of a crash. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact the performance of read and write operations, as it directly affects the efficiency of cache utilization and recovery processes. Therefore, variations in this setting can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource consumption."
