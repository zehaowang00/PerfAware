    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the threshold for garbage collection (GC) warnings. If this threshold is set too low, it can lead to frequent GC warnings, indicating that the system is spending excessive time in garbage collection, which can significantly impact application performance. Conversely, if set too high, it may mask performance issues, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
