    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to disk. Changes in this setting can significantly affect the amount of data written, the speed of write operations, and the overall I/O performance. If compression is enabled, it can reduce the disk space used and improve write performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be flushed to disk. Conversely, if compression is disabled, it may lead to increased disk usage and slower write times due to larger data volumes being written. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
