    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is replicated across nodes in the cluster. When enabled, transient replication allows for a more flexible and potentially faster data write process, as it can reduce the overhead of maintaining consistency across replicas. However, this can also lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially under high load or in scenarios with network latency. Changes to this setting can significantly impact overall system performance, including read and write latencies, as well as resource utilization, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
