    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of virtual nodes (vnodes) that data is divided into across the cluster. A change in this value can significantly impact data distribution, load balancing, and the efficiency of read/write operations. If the number of tokens is too low, it can lead to hotspots and uneven data distribution, causing increased latency and reduced throughput. Conversely, if the number is too high, it may lead to excessive overhead in managing the tokens, resulting in increased memory consumption and slower performance during data operations. Therefore, variations in 'num_tokens' can lead to notable changes in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
