    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'endpoint_snitch' configuration in Cassandra determines how nodes in the cluster are aware of each other's network topology. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact data distribution, replication strategies, and request routing. An incorrect or suboptimal setting can lead to increased latency, inefficient resource usage, and uneven load distribution, which directly affects system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and overall system efficiency."
