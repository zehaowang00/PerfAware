    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences how the dynamic snitching mechanism operates. This interval determines how often the system resets the performance metrics of nodes in the cluster. A shorter reset interval can lead to more frequent adjustments in request routing based on the current performance of nodes, potentially improving response times and load balancing. Conversely, a longer interval may result in suboptimal routing decisions, causing increased latency and uneven resource utilization. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and overall system performance."
