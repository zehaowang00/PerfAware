    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' in Cassandra directly impacts how the system handles hinted handoffs, which are crucial for maintaining data consistency in distributed environments. If the file size limit is set too low, it can lead to increased execution time as the system may need to frequently flush hints, causing higher disk I/O and potential delays in processing. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory consumption and longer recovery times, as the system attempts to manage larger hint files. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect both execution time and memory usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
