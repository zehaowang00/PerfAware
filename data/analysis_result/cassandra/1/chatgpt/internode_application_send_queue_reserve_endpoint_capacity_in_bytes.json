    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the capacity of the send queue for inter-node communication. A change in this value can lead to variations in how much data can be buffered before being sent to other nodes. If the capacity is too low, it can cause increased latency and reduced throughput due to frequent blocking or dropping of messages, impacting overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory consumption, which can also degrade performance. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can significantly influence execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
