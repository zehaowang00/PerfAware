    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_flush_writers' configuration in Cassandra determines the number of threads responsible for flushing memtables to disk. A change in this value can significantly impact the write performance and overall throughput of the system. If set too low, it can lead to increased write latencies and backlogs, as memtables fill up faster than they can be flushed. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to excessive disk I/O and contention, negatively affecting read performance and potentially overwhelming the disk subsystem. Therefore, variations in this configuration directly influence execution time and resource utilization, making it performance-sensitive."
