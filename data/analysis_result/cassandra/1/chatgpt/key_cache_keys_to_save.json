    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_keys_to_save' in Cassandra determines the number of keys that are stored in the key cache. A change in this value can significantly impact performance because it directly affects how many keys can be cached in memory. If the value is set too low, it may lead to increased cache misses, resulting in more frequent disk accesses and longer execution times for read operations. Conversely, if set too high, it may consume excessive memory resources, potentially leading to memory pressure and affecting overall system performance. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
