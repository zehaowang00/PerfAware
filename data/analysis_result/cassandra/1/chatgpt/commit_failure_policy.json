    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in Cassandra determines how the system responds to write failures. Changing this policy can significantly impact performance, as it affects the durability and availability of writes. For instance, if the policy is set to 'ignore', the system may proceed with operations even when some writes fail, potentially leading to faster execution times but at the cost of data consistency. Conversely, setting it to 'abort' ensures data integrity but may lead to increased latency and resource consumption during write operations. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
