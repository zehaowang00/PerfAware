    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'disk_optimization_strategy' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how data is written to and read from disk. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in I/O operations, which in turn affect overall execution time and resource consumption. For instance, selecting a more aggressive optimization strategy may reduce latency for read and write operations, while a less optimized strategy could lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times. Therefore, variations in this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
