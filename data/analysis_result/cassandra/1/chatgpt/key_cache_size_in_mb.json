    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching keys. A larger key cache can significantly reduce the number of disk reads required during query execution, thus improving response times and overall throughput. Conversely, a smaller key cache may lead to increased disk I/O, resulting in higher latency and reduced performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
