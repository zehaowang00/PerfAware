    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration in Cassandra determines the time-to-live (TTL) for tracing queries. A change in this value can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting how long tracing data is retained and how often it is purged. If the TTL is set too high, it can lead to increased memory consumption due to the accumulation of trace data, which can slow down the system and affect query performance. Conversely, a very low TTL may result in insufficient tracing information for performance analysis, potentially leading to challenges in identifying bottlenecks. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable differences in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
