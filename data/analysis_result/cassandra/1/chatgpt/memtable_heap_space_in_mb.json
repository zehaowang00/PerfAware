    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for write operations. A change in this configuration can significantly affect the system's performance, as insufficient heap space can lead to increased write amplification, higher garbage collection overhead, and potential out-of-memory errors. Conversely, allocating too much memory can lead to inefficient use of resources and impact the performance of other components. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause notable changes in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
