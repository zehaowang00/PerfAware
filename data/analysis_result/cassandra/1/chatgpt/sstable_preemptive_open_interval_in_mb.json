    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' in Cassandra directly influences how SSTables are managed in memory. A change in this value can significantly impact the amount of memory allocated for preemptively opening SSTables, which in turn affects read performance and memory consumption. If the interval is set too low, it may lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times due to frequent SSTable accesses. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage, potentially causing garbage collection issues or out-of-memory errors. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to notable changes in system performance."
