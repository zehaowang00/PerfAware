    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly affects how many counter updates can be processed simultaneously. Increasing this value can lead to improved throughput and reduced latency for write operations, especially in high-load scenarios. Conversely, setting it too low can create bottlenecks, resulting in increased execution time for writes and potential memory consumption issues due to queued operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance."
