    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'commitlog_segment_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the way commit logs are managed and stored. A smaller segment size can lead to more frequent segment rollovers, increasing disk I/O operations and potentially causing higher latency during write operations. Conversely, a larger segment size may improve write performance by reducing the frequency of rollovers, but it can also lead to increased memory consumption and longer recovery times in case of a failure. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact execution time and resource utilization, making it critical for performance tuning."
