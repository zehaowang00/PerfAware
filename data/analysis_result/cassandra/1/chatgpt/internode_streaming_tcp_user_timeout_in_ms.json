    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timeout behavior of TCP connections between nodes during data streaming operations. A lower timeout value may lead to premature disconnections and increased retries, which can significantly impact execution time and throughput. Conversely, a higher timeout can lead to increased resource consumption if connections remain open longer than necessary. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and memory consumption, making it crucial for performance tuning."
