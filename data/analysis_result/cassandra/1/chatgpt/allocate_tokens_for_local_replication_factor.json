    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in Cassandra directly influences how tokens are allocated for data distribution across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this setting can significantly affect the load balancing of data, which in turn impacts read and write performance, as well as the overall system throughput. A poorly configured replication factor can lead to uneven data distribution, increased latency, and higher resource consumption, making this configuration critical for maintaining optimal performance in a distributed database environment."
