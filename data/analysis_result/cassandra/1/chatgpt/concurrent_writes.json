    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration in Cassandra directly affects the number of write operations that can be processed simultaneously. Increasing this value can lead to higher throughput and reduced write latency, but it also increases contention for resources such as CPU and I/O bandwidth. Conversely, setting it too low can lead to underutilization of system resources, resulting in slower write performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
