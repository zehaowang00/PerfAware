    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration in Cassandra directly influences how memtables are flushed to disk. A lower threshold can lead to more frequent flushes, which increases disk I/O and can significantly impact overall system performance, especially under heavy write loads. Conversely, a higher threshold may delay flushes, leading to increased memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors if not managed properly. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
