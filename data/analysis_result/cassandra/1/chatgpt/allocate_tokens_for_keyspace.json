    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the distribution of data across nodes in a cluster. Changes to this setting can lead to significant variations in how data is partitioned and accessed, which in turn affects read and write latencies, load balancing, and overall system throughput. If this configuration is not optimized, it can result in uneven data distribution and hotspots, causing some nodes to be overloaded while others are underutilized. Consequently, this can lead to increased execution times and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
