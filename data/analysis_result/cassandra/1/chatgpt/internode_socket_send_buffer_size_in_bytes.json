    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' in Cassandra directly influences the amount of data that can be buffered for sending between nodes in a distributed environment. A larger buffer size can lead to improved throughput and reduced latency during data transmission, especially under high load conditions. Conversely, a smaller buffer size may result in increased packet loss and retransmissions, which can significantly degrade system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and network efficiency, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
