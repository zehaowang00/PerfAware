    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' in Cassandra determines the total amount of disk space allocated for commit logs. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance because if the allocated space is too low, it can lead to frequent rollovers of commit logs, which may increase write latency and affect overall throughput. Conversely, allocating too much space can lead to inefficient disk usage and potential resource wastage. Therefore, variations in this configuration can notably affect execution time and resource consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
