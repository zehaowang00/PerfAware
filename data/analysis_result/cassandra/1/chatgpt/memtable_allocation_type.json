    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration in Cassandra determines how memory is allocated for memtables, which are in-memory data structures used for writes. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact memory usage and garbage collection behavior, leading to variations in execution time and overall system performance. For example, using a different allocation type may result in more efficient memory usage or reduced fragmentation, directly affecting the throughput and latency of write operations. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
