    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration in Cassandra can significantly influence system performance because it determines how nodes are organized and interact within a cluster. Changes to the cluster name can affect data distribution, replication strategies, and even the routing of requests among nodes. If the cluster name is altered, it may lead to increased latency in data access or inconsistencies in data replication, which can notably impact execution time and resource utilization across the system."
