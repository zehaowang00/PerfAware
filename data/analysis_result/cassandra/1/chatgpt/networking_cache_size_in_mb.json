    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra directly influences the amount of memory allocated for caching network-related data. A larger cache size can significantly improve performance by reducing latency and increasing throughput, especially under high load conditions. Conversely, setting this value too low can lead to increased network traffic and higher execution times due to frequent cache misses. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
