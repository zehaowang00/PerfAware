    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum time allowed for a range request to complete. If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts and retries, significantly increasing execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, if set too high, it may cause the system to hold resources longer than necessary, affecting overall throughput and responsiveness. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
