    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the way clients connect to the database. When enabled, it allows native transport protocol connections, which can significantly enhance performance by reducing latency and improving throughput for client-server interactions. Conversely, disabling this option can lead to increased execution times and higher resource consumption due to the fallback to less efficient communication methods. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in overall system performance."
