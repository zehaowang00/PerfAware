The operations involved in creating links for the SSTable readers are not inherently time-intensive or memory-intensive, as they primarily involve file system interactions that are generally lightweight. While the operation may involve multiple SSTableReaders, it does not indicate a substantial system-level performance impact that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
