A poorly set threshold can lead to excessive memory usage or frequent cleanups, resulting in significant performance degradation during memory-intensive operations. Since the memtable is critical for database performance, any substantial misconfiguration can lead to time-intensive flush operations or increased memory pressure, thus classifying it as performance sensitive."
