If the throughput is set too low, it can cause prolonged compaction times, leading to increased latency and resource consumption. Conversely, setting it too high may overwhelm system resources, causing performance degradation. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance due to its potential for time-intensive operations during data compaction."
