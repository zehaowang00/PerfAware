            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `max_concurrent_auto_upgrade_tasks` configuration directly influences the number of concurrent upgrade tasks that can be executed. If this value is set too high, it may lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O), especially during time-intensive operations like upgrading SSTables, which can significantly impact overall system performance. Conversely, if set too low, it could lead to underutilization of resources, delaying necessary upgrades and potentially causing performance bottlenecks. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance, classifying it as performance sensitive."
