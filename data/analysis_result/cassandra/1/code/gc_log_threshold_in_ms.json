            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The garbage collection (GC) process can significantly impact system performance, especially in applications with high memory usage or long-running processes. The `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` configuration directly relates to the timing of garbage collection events, which can lead to substantial variations in application performance. If the threshold is set too low, it may cause excessive logging and overhead during GC, leading to increased latency and memory consumption. Conversely, if set too high, it may obscure critical performance issues. Therefore, this configuration is crucial for optimizing GC behavior and overall system performance."
