While it may influence logging behavior, it does not directly impact system performance in terms of time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The logging operation itself is not a significant performance bottleneck, and the threshold check does not lead to substantial resource consumption or delays. Therefore, it does not qualify as performance-sensitive."
