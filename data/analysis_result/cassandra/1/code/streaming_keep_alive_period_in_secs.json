            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs` directly influences the frequency of keep-alive tasks scheduled for a channel. If this period is set too low, it can lead to excessive task scheduling, resulting in increased CPU usage and potential memory overhead due to the accumulation of scheduled tasks. Conversely, if set too high, it may lead to delayed responses and inefficient resource utilization. The impact of this configuration on system performance is significant, as it affects the responsiveness and resource management of the streaming process."
