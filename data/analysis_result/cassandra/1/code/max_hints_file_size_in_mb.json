            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `maxHintsFileSize` directly influences the amount of data that can be buffered and written in a single session. If this size is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage during the writing process, potentially causing memory pressure and impacting overall system performance. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to more frequent write operations, increasing the time spent in I/O operations. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on performance due to its effect on both memory usage and time-intensive write operations."
