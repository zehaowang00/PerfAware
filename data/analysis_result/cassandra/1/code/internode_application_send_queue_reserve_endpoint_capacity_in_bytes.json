If this configuration is set improperly, it can lead to bottlenecks or excessive memory usage, resulting in substantial performance degradation during high-load scenarios. The operation of retrieving this configuration from `DatabaseDescriptor` indicates that it can have a direct impact on system performance, especially in time-intensive or memory-intensive operations related to message sending."
