A larger memory pool may lead to increased memory consumption, potentially causing garbage collection overhead and impacting overall system performance. Conversely, a smaller pool may lead to insufficient memory for operations, resulting in performance degradation. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for system-level performance due to its potential for time-intensive memory management operations."
