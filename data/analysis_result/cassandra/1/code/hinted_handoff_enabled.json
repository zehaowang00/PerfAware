            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: The `hinted_handoff_enabled` configuration primarily influences whether hints are sent to replicas based on their state and data center status. While it does involve checking conditions related to replica status and data center configurations, these checks do not involve time-intensive or memory-intensive operations that would significantly impact overall system performance. The operations performed in the `shouldHint` method are mostly conditional checks and do not entail heavy computations or resource consumption that would classify them as performance-sensitive."
