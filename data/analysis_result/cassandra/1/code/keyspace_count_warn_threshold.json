While having a large number of keyspaces may slow down schema-dependent operations, the threshold itself does not directly cause significant performance variations or involve time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The operations involved in checking the count of keyspaces and logging warnings are relatively lightweight and do not have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
