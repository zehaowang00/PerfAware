            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `gc_warn_threshold_in_ms` configuration directly relates to the behavior of the garbage collector, which is a critical component in managing memory in Java applications. If this threshold is set improperly, it can lead to significant delays in garbage collection cycles, causing increased pause times and memory pressure, which can severely impact application performance. The operations involved in querying and managing garbage collection metrics are inherently time-intensive and can lead to substantial performance variations if not handled correctly."
