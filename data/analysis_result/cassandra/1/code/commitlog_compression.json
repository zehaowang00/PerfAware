Compression can reduce the amount of data written to disk, which can lead to time savings in write operations, especially under high load. However, it also introduces CPU overhead for compressing and decompressing data, which can be substantial if the data volume is large or if the compression algorithm is computationally intensive. Therefore, variations in this configuration can lead to significant performance differences in terms of both time and resource utilization."
