If the synchronization period is too long, it could lead to data loss in case of failures, while a very short period may increase I/O operations and CPU usage, impacting overall system performance. The method `getPeriodicCommitLogSyncBlock()` calculates a value based on this configuration, indicating its critical role in performance-sensitive operations related to commit log management."
