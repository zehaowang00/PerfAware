            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The size of the counter cache (in MB) directly influences the memory allocation for the cache, which can lead to significant memory usage depending on the configured size. A larger cache can improve performance by reducing the frequency of cache misses, but it also increases memory consumption, which can affect overall system performance, particularly if the system is constrained in memory resources. Additionally, the operations related to saving keys and managing the cache can become time-intensive if the cache size is substantial, leading to potential delays in processing. Thus, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance."
