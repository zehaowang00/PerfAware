            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `memtable_heap_space_in_mb` directly influences the memory allocation strategy for memtables, which can significantly affect the performance of database operations. The choice of allocation type (e.g., `HeapPool`, `SlabPool`, `NativePool`) and the limits set by this configuration can lead to substantial variations in memory usage and garbage collection behavior, impacting the overall throughput and latency of database operations. Since these factors are critical in high-performance database systems, this configuration is classified as performance sensitive."
