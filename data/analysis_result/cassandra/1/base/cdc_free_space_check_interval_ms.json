The executor uses a synchronous queue and a discard policy for handling tasks.\n\n### Key Functionalities Related to Configuration:\n- **Size Tracking**: The `CDCSizeTracker` class is responsible for tracking the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem, which includes unflushed segments and archived segments.\n- **Dynamic State Management**: The state of each commit log segment regarding CDC is dynamically managed based on the current size and the allowable CDC bytes.\n- **Error Handling**: If a mutation is rejected due to insufficient space, a warning log is generated indicating the need to free up space in the CDC log location.\n\nThis configuration allows for efficient management of the commit log segments while ensuring that CDC data is tracked and maintained within defined limits."

            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Configuration Summary for `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms`\n\nThe `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration plays a crucial role in managing the disk space used by Change Data Capture (CDC) logs within the system. Its primary purpose is to define the interval at which the system checks the disk usage of CDC logs, ensuring that sufficient space is available for ongoing operations.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **CDCSizeTracker**:\n   - This class is responsible for tracking the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem. It utilizes the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration to regulate how often it recalculates the size of the CDC logs.\n\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**:\n   - The configuration relies on values defined in `DatabaseDescriptor`, such as `getCDCDiskCheckInterval()`, which provides the interval in milliseconds for checking the disk space.\n\n3. **CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC**:\n   - This class initializes the `CDCSizeTracker` and invokes its methods to manage the CDC log's disk usage. It also handles the allocation of space for mutations that are tracked by CDC.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration interacts with the `CDCSizeTracker` to determine when to perform size calculations. The `RateLimiter` in `CDCSizeTracker` uses this interval to control the frequency of size checks, preventing excessive resource consumption during these operations.\n- The configuration indirectly influences the behavior of mutation handling in the `CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC`. If the available space for CDC logs falls below a certain threshold, the system may reject new mutations, prompting the need for additional space management.\n\nIn summary, the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration is essential for maintaining the health and efficiency of the CDC subsystem by ensuring timely checks of disk space usage, thus enabling effective management of CDC logs and preventing potential data loss due to insufficient storage."

Its primary purpose is to define the interval at which the system checks the disk usage of CDC logs, ensuring that sufficient space is available for ongoing operations.\\n\\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\\n1. **CDCSizeTracker**:\\n   - This class is responsible for tracking the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem. It utilizes the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration to regulate how often it recalculates the size of the CDC logs.\\n\\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**:\\n   - The configuration relies on values defined in `DatabaseDescriptor`, such as `getCDCDiskCheckInterval()`, which provides the interval in milliseconds for checking the disk space.\\n\\n3. **CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC**:\\n   - This class initializes the `CDCSizeTracker` and invokes its methods to manage the CDC log's disk usage. It also handles the allocation of space for mutations that are tracked by CDC.\\n\\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\\n- The `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration interacts with the `CDCSizeTracker` to determine when to perform size calculations. The `RateLimiter` in `CDCSizeTracker` uses this interval to control the frequency of size checks, preventing excessive resource consumption during these operations.\\n- The configuration indirectly influences the behavior of mutation handling in the `CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC`. If the available space for CDC logs falls below a certain threshold, the system may reject new mutations, prompting the need for additional space management.\\n\\nIn summary, the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration is essential for maintaining the health and efficiency of the CDC subsystem by ensuring timely checks of disk space usage, thus enabling effective management of CDC logs and preventing potential data loss due to insufficient storage.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up review.

Its primary purpose is to define the interval at which the system checks the disk usage of CDC logs, ensuring that sufficient space is available for ongoing operations.\\n\\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\\n1. **CDCSizeTracker**:\\n   - This class is responsible for tracking the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem. It utilizes the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration to regulate how often it recalculates the size of the CDC logs.\\n\\n2. **DatabaseDescriptor**:\\n   - The configuration relies on values defined in `DatabaseDescriptor`, such as `getCDCDiskCheckInterval()`, which provides the interval in milliseconds for checking the disk space.\\n\\n3. **CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC**:\\n   - This class initializes the `CDCSizeTracker` and invokes its methods to manage the CDC log's disk usage. It also handles the allocation of space for mutations that are tracked by CDC.\\n\\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\\n- The `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration interacts with the `CDCSizeTracker` to determine when to perform size calculations. The `RateLimiter` in `CDCSizeTracker` uses this interval to control the frequency of size checks, preventing excessive resource consumption during these operations.\\n- The configuration indirectly influences the behavior of mutation handling in the `CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC`. If the available space for CDC logs falls below a certain threshold, the system may reject new mutations, prompting the need for additional space management.\\n\\nIn summary, the `cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms` configuration is essential for maintaining the health and efficiency of the CDC subsystem by ensuring timely checks of disk space usage, thus enabling effective management of CDC logs and preventing potential data loss due to insufficient storage.\"}"

If the interval is set too low, it may cause frequent and time-consuming disk size calculations, potentially leading to increased CPU and I/O usage. Conversely, if set too high, it may result in insufficient space checks, leading to rejected mutations and potential data loss. Thus, the performance impact of this configuration is substantial due to its effect on system resource utilization and operational efficiency."
