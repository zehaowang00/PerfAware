Its primary purpose is to enable or disable the tracking of data that has been repaired across multiple replicas, which is essential for ensuring data consistency and integrity in distributed systems.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for managing various configuration settings within the system.
