Its primary purpose is to define the reserve capacity for the send queue at the endpoint level, ensuring that there is a buffer available for outgoing messages.\n\n#### Functionality and Interactions:\n\n1. **Initialization of Reserve Limits**:\n   - The configuration is utilized within the method `withDefaultReserveLimits()`, which initializes the outbound connection settings. This method checks if the `applicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes` is already set; if not, it retrieves the default value from `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes()`. This ensures that the application has a defined limit for the send queue capacity.\n\n2. **Dependency on Global Settings**:\n   - The configuration interacts with the global capacity settings through the variable `applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes`. If this global capacity is not set, it defaults to a value provided by `MessagingService.instance().outboundGlobalReserveLimit`. This establishes a dependency on both local and global settings for effective queue management.\n\n3. **Integration with Connection Settings**:\n   - The configuration is ultimately passed to the method `withApplicationReserveSendQueueCapacityInBytes()`, which constructs a new instance of `OutboundConnectionSettings`. This method takes both the endpoint and global capacities as parameters, integrating them into the overall connection settings that dictate how the application manages its outbound messaging.\n\n4. **Key Components**:\n   - The configuration is part of a broader system that includes various components such as `DatabaseDescriptor`, `MessagingService`, and `OutboundConnectionSettings`. Each of these components plays a role in ensuring that the application can effectively manage its messaging capabilities, with the configuration serving as a critical parameter for defining capacity limits.\n\nIn summary, `internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes` is essential for setting the reserve limits of outbound message queues, ensuring that the application can handle message flow efficiently while interacting with both local and global capacity settings."
