Its primary purpose is to determine whether SASI indexes can be utilized when creating or modifying database schemas.\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - This configuration enables or disables the use of SASI indexes in the Cassandra database. When enabled, it allows users to create custom indexes that can optimize query performance for specific use cases.\\n\\n2. **Functionality**:\\n   - The configuration is checked within the `apply(Keyspaces schema)` method. If the `attrs.isCustom` attribute is set to true and the custom class specified is `SASIIndex`, the method verifies the status of this configuration using `DatabaseDescriptor.getEnableSASIIndexes()`. If SASI indexes are not enabled, an exception is thrown, indicating that the user must enable this feature in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The functionality of SASI indexes is dependent on the correct setting of this configuration. If it is disabled, any attempts to create SASI indexes will fail, leading to exceptions being raised during schema modifications.\\n   - This configuration interacts with the `attrs` object, which contains metadata about the index being created, and is crucial for the validation process before index creation.\\n\\n4. **Key Components**:\\n   - **`DatabaseDescriptor`**: This component is responsible for retrieving the current configuration settings, including whether SASI indexes are enabled.\\n   - **`Keyspaces` and `TableMetadata`**: These components are involved in the overall schema management and validation process, ensuring that the necessary conditions for creating indexes are met.\\n\\nIn summary, the `enable_sasi_indexes` configuration is essential for controlling the use of SASI indexes within the Cassandra database. It directly influences the behavior of schema modification operations and must be properly configured to allow for the effective use of custom indexing strategies.\"}"

Enabling or disabling this feature can lead to substantial variations in performance, especially in scenarios involving complex queries or large datasets. The presence of SASI indexes can optimize read operations, but if misconfigured or disabled, it can lead to inefficient query execution and increased latency, making it a critical factor for performance sensitivity."
