The choice of consistency level can lead to significant variations in performance, particularly in scenarios involving high write loads or complex network topologies. The handling of different consistency levels, especially in methods like `getWriteResponseHandler`, may introduce time-intensive operations, particularly when constructing delegate response handlers or managing local versus quorum-based writes. Therefore, the configuration has the potential for substantial performance impact due to the nature of write operations and their dependencies on consistency guarantees."
