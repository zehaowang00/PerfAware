            "content": "Summary of the extracted code context: ### Configuration Summary for `index_summary_capacity_in_mb`\n\nThe `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration plays a crucial role in managing the memory allocation for the `IndexSummaryManager` within the system. This configuration determines the size of the memory pool allocated for storing index summaries, which are essential for optimizing read operations in a database environment.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Memory Pool Size**: The configuration specifies the maximum size of the memory pool in megabytes that the `IndexSummaryManager` can utilize. This is retrieved from the `DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB()` method during the initialization of the `IndexSummaryManager`.\n- **Initialization**: Upon instantiation of the `IndexSummaryManager`, the memory pool size is logged for tracking purposes, and the memory pool capacity is set accordingly using the `setMemoryPoolCapacityInMB(long size)` method.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to fetch the memory pool size. This class serves as a central repository for various configuration parameters within the system.\n- **Logging**: The initialization process includes logging the memory pool size, which aids in monitoring and debugging.\n- **Memory Management**: The `IndexSummaryManager` utilizes the configured memory pool size to manage index summaries effectively, which can enhance the performance of read operations by reducing the need for disk access.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **IndexSummaryManager**: The primary component that utilizes the `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration to manage memory for index summaries.\n- **Methods**:\n  - `setMemoryPoolCapacityInMB(long size)`: This method is called to set the memory pool size based on the configuration value.\n  - `setResizeIntervalInMinutes(int interval)`: Although not explicitly detailed in the provided context, this method is also part of the configuration's role in managing the index summary.\n\nIn summary, the `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration is essential for defining the memory allocation for the `IndexSummaryManager`, ensuring efficient management of index summaries, and facilitating optimal database operations."
