If it is, the method returns early, indicating that the failure detection confidence is not high enough to convict the endpoint.\n   - If the endpoint is convicted (i.e., `phi` is sufficiently high), an error is logged, and a force shutdown is initiated.\n\n3. **Handling Coordinator Failures**:\n   - The second `convict(InetAddressAndPort ep, double phi)` method also uses the Phi Convict Threshold to determine if a remote node (potentially a coordinator) should be marked as failed. If the `phi` value is below the threshold or if there are no parent repair sessions, the method returns without taking action.\n   - If the conditions are met, it triggers an abort for the corresponding parent repair sessions.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The Phi Convict Threshold is a critical configuration parameter that influences failure detection and recovery processes.\n- The logic ensures that only endpoints with a high confidence of failure are acted upon, reducing the risk of erroneous convictions during repair operations."
