A larger buffer size can improve throughput and reduce the frequency of network calls, while a smaller buffer may lead to increased latency and potential bottlenecks. Given that network communication can be a critical performance factor in distributed systems, variations in this configuration can lead to substantial performance differences, making it performance-sensitive."
