This configuration determines whether the system allows the removal of compact storage from tables.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of the `enable_drop_compact_storage` configuration is to control the ability to drop compact storage from tables. If this configuration is disabled, any attempt to perform this operation will result in an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that the operation is not permitted unless explicitly enabled in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for retrieving the current state of the configuration, specifically checking the status of `enableDropCompactStorage`.\n- **KeyspaceMetadata**: Represents the metadata of the keyspace being altered, which includes information about the tables it contains.\n- **TableMetadata**: Contains the metadata of the specific table that is being modified, including whether it is a compact table and its associated flags.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The method checks if the `enable_drop_compact_storage` configuration is true before proceeding with the operation. If it is false, the method halts execution and throws an exception.\n- The method also verifies if the table in question is a compact table. If it is not, another exception is thrown, preventing the operation from being executed on an incompatible table type.\n- The method further interacts with the `validateCanDropCompactStorage()` function, which likely contains additional logic to ensure that the operation can be safely performed.\n- Finally, if all checks pass, the method updates the keyspace and table metadata to reflect the new state after dropping compact storage, utilizing the `withSwapped` method to create updated instances of the metadata.\n\nIn summary, the `enable_drop_compact_storage` configuration is essential for controlling schema modifications related to compact storage in Cassandra, ensuring that such operations are performed under the right conditions and maintaining the integrity of the database structure."
