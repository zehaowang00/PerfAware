This configuration is part of the broader user-defined functions feature in Cassandra, which allows users to define custom functions that can be executed within the database.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` is to control the execution of scripted UDFs, which are functions written in languages other than Java. This setting ensures that only authorized and secure scripted functions can be executed, thereby providing a layer of security against potentially harmful scripts.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `assertUdfsEnabled` checks the status of two key configurations: `enableUserDefinedFunctions` and `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions`.\n- If user-defined functions are globally disabled (`enableUserDefinedFunctions` returns false), an `InvalidRequestException` is thrown, indicating that UDFs cannot be used unless explicitly enabled in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\n- If the requested function language is not Java and scripted UDFs are disabled (`enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` returns false), another `InvalidRequestException` is thrown, warning the user to enable this setting if they are aware of the associated security risks.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- This configuration directly depends on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which retrieves the settings from the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file.\n- The interaction between `assertUdfsEnabled` and the configuration settings ensures that the system can enforce security policies related to the execution of user-defined functions.\n- The method acts as a gatekeeper, preventing the execution of potentially unsafe scripted functions unless explicitly allowed by the configuration.\n\nOverall, `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions` is essential for managing the security and functionality of user-defined functions in the Cassandra database, ensuring that only approved scripts can be executed based on the system's configuration settings."
