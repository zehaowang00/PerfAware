The choice between periodic, batch, or group synchronization can lead to substantial variations in write latency and throughput. For instance, batch processing may optimize write operations by reducing the frequency of disk I/O, while periodic synchronization could lead to increased latency during peak write loads. Therefore, the configuration's effect on time-intensive operations related to data integrity and consistency makes it performance sensitive."
