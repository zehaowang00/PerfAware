This configuration is primarily governed by the method `computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables()`.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe purpose of this configuration is to control the behavior of data streaming in the context of SSTables, ensuring that data is only streamed when certain conditions are met. This is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency during transfers.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method checks two key conditions:\n  1. **Full SSTable Transfers Disabled**: It queries the `DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables()` method to determine if full SSTable transfers are enabled. If this returns `false`, the method will not proceed with streaming.\n  2. **Legacy Counter Shards**: It examines the metadata of the SSTable through `ref.get().getSSTableMetadata().hasLegacyCounterShards`. If legacy counter shards are present, streaming is also disabled.\n\nIf either of these conditions is true, the method returns `false`, indicating that streaming should not occur. If both conditions are satisfied, the method proceeds to check if the current SSTable is contained within the specified sections, ultimately determining whether to allow the streaming operation.\n\n#### Dependencies and Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing configuration settings, including the status of full SSTable streaming.\n- **SSTable Metadata**: The metadata associated with the SSTable is accessed to check for legacy counter shards, which influences the decision to stream.\n- **Reference Object (`ref`)**: This object is used to access the current SSTable and its associated metadata.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables()` method interacts with the broader data streaming functionality within the system. By controlling whether entire SSTables can be streamed, it ensures that the data transfer mechanisms operate under the correct conditions, thereby influencing how data is managed and transferred across the system.\n\nIn summary, the `stream_entire_sstables` configuration is integral to the data streaming logic, ensuring that SSTables are only streamed when appropriate, based on specific system settings and metadata conditions."
