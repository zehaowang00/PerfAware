            "content": "The configuration is Performance Insensitive: While the `key_cache_save_period` affects how often cache entries are saved to persistent storage, the operation of saving itself is not inherently time-intensive or memory-heavy. The performance impact of this configuration is more about data integrity and consistency rather than significant variations in system performance. The saving process is likely to be executed in a background thread, minimizing its impact on the main application flow, and thus does not qualify as performance-sensitive."
