This configuration plays a crucial role in determining how long a connection can remain idle before being considered inactive and subsequently closed.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **Method `tcpUserTimeoutInMS(ConnectionCategory category)`**:\n   - This method takes a `ConnectionCategory` as an argument, which can be either `MESSAGING` or `STREAMING`.\n   - It checks if a local variable `tcpUserTimeoutInMS` is already set; if so, it returns that value.\n   - If not set, it retrieves the appropriate timeout value based on the connection category:\n     - For `MESSAGING`, it calls `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`.\n     - For `STREAMING`, it calls `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`.\n   - If an unknown category is provided, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n\n2. **Method `getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()`**:\n   - This method directly retrieves the TCP user timeout value for internode communication from the `DatabaseDescriptor`, ensuring that the timeout setting is consistently accessed throughout the system.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The configuration relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which houses the methods for fetching the timeout values. This indicates that the configuration is dependent on the underlying database settings and structure.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `tcpUserTimeoutInMS` method is likely called by other components in the system that manage connections, ensuring that the timeout settings are applied consistently across different types of connections.\n- By centralizing the timeout configuration, the system can maintain a uniform approach to connection management, which is essential for both messaging and streaming operations.\n\nOverall, the `internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms` configuration serves as a critical component for managing TCP connection timeouts, ensuring that the system operates effectively across different connection types while relying on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for its settings."
