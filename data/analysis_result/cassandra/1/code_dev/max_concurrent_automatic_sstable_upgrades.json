This configuration plays a crucial role in managing the upgrade tasks that are triggered during the compaction process, which is essential for maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the database.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **CompactionStrategyManager**: This component is responsible for managing the compaction strategies applied to the SSTables. It interacts with the upgrade task functionality by providing the method `findUpgradeSSTableTask()`, which identifies if there are any upgrade tasks available to execute.\n\n2. **AbstractCompactionTask**: Represents the upgrade task itself. If an upgrade task is found, it is executed by calling the `execute(active)` method, which performs the necessary operations to upgrade the SSTable.\n\n3. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class contains the static method `maxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasks()`, which retrieves the value of the `max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades` configuration. This method is crucial for determining whether a new upgrade task can be initiated based on the current count of background upgrading tasks.\n\n4. **currentlyBackgroundUpgrading**: This is a counter that tracks the number of currently running background upgrade tasks. It is incremented when a new task is checked for execution and decremented once the task is completed or if no task is executed.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe configuration interacts primarily with the compaction management system. When the `maybeRunUpgradeTask` method is invoked, it checks if the number of currently running upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the configured maximum.
