If the queue capacity is set too low, it may result in message loss or delays in processing, causing time-intensive operations as the system struggles to manage incoming messages. Conversely, setting it too high can lead to excessive memory usage, impacting overall system performance. Therefore, this configuration has substantial implications for both time and memory efficiency in a distributed messaging system."
