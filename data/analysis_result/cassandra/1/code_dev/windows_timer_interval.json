This adjustment is essential as it affects various system-level operations, including timer intervals, thread scheduling, and driver interrupts.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing the `windows_timer_interval` value, which is utilized to set the timer period accurately.\n- **FBUtilities**: A utility class that checks if the operating system is Windows, ensuring that the timer adjustments are only applied in the appropriate environment.\n- **WindowsTimer**: This class manages the starting and stopping of the timer period based on the configuration value.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n1. **Activation Process**: During the `activate()` method, the configuration is applied through the `applyConfig()` method.
