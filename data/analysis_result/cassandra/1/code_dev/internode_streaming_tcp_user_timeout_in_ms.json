This configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which serves as a centralized repository for various system parameters.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of this configuration is to define the maximum duration (in milliseconds) that the system will wait for a response during streaming operations before considering the connection as timed out. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and responsiveness of streaming processes.\n- The method `tcpUserTimeoutInMS(ConnectionCategory category)` retrieves the appropriate timeout value based on the connection category, which can either be `MESSAGING` or `STREAMING`.
