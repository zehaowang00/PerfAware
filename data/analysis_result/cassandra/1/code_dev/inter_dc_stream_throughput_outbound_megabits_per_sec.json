This configuration plays a crucial role in managing the data transfer rate between different data centers, ensuring that the system can effectively control the flow of data based on the specified limits.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for storing and retrieving the configuration value. The methods `getInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec()` and `setInterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec(int value)` are used to access and update the throughput setting.\n   \n2. **StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter**: This component is responsible for enforcing the throughput limit during data transfers. The method `updateInterDCThroughput()` is called after the configuration is set, indicating that the system should adjust its streaming behavior according to the new throughput value.\n\n3. **Logger**: The logging functionality captures changes to the throughput setting, providing a record of the current and previous values. This is useful for tracking configuration changes over time.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec(int value)` method allows for dynamic updates to the throughput configuration. When a new value is set, the old value is retrieved and logged, and the StreamRateLimiter is updated to reflect the change.\n  \n- The `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec()` method provides a way for other components in the system to retrieve the current throughput setting, ensuring that they can operate within the defined limits.\n\n- The `calculateInterDCRateInBytes()` method converts the throughput from megabits to bytes, which is essential for other components that require data in byte format for processing.\n\nOverall, this configuration is integral to maintaining control over data transfer rates between data centers, ensuring that the system operates within specified limits while allowing for dynamic adjustments as needed."

If set too low, it may throttle data transfers excessively, causing delays and negatively impacting overall system throughput. Conversely, setting it too high could lead to resource contention or network saturation. The performance impact is substantial due to the potential for time-intensive operations during data streaming, making this configuration critical for maintaining optimal performance in a distributed environment."
