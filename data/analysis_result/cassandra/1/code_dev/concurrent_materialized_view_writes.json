This method checks the keyspace and replication strategy to determine if updates should be processed in the context of the views.\n\n3. **Keyspace Interaction**: The configuration interacts closely with the `Keyspace` class, as it verifies that the mutations pertain to the correct keyspace and considers the replication strategy when determining the impact of updates on views.\n\n4. **Lock Acquisition**: The `acquireLockFor` method provides a way to obtain a lock for a specific key and column family ID hash.
