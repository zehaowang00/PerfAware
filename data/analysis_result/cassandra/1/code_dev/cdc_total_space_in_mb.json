It retrieves the CDC space configuration from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class through the method `getCDCSpaceInMB()`, which returns the space in megabytes. The method then converts this value into bytes by multiplying it by 1024 twice (once for kilobytes and once for bytes).\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is a key component that holds configuration settings for the database, including the CDC space allocation. The method `getCDCSpaceInMB()` is a dependency that provides the necessary configuration value.\n- **CDC (Change Data Capture)**: The configuration is integral to the CDC functionality, which tracks changes in the database and is essential for data replication and synchronization processes.\n\nThe `allowableCDCBytes` method serves as a utility function that ensures other parts of the system can access the total allowable CDC space in bytes, facilitating operations that depend on this configuration. This method acts as a bridge between the configuration settings and the business logic that requires knowledge of the CDC space allocation."
