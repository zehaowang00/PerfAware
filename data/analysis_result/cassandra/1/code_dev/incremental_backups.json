Its primary purpose is to determine whether incremental backups are enabled, allowing the system to conditionally execute backup operations based on this setting.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for holding the configuration settings. The method `isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()` checks the status of the incremental backups feature.\n2. **SSTableReader**: Represents the data structures that are being backed up. The backup process involves creating links for these SSTables.\n3. **Directories**: This utility helps in determining the appropriate backup directory for each SSTable based on its descriptor.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `maybeIncrementallyBackup()` initiates the backup process. It first checks if incremental backups are enabled by calling `DatabaseDescriptor.isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()`. If this check returns false, the method exits early, preventing any backup operations.\n- If backups are enabled, the method iterates through the provided iterable of SSTableReader objects. For each SSTable, it retrieves the corresponding backup directory using `Directories.getBackupsDirectory(sstable.descriptor)` and creates symbolic links to the SSTable files in that directory using `sstable.createLinks()`.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The configuration interacts closely with the `DatabaseDescriptor` to determine the backup capability.\n- It also relies on the `Directories` class to manage file paths and the `SSTableReader` class to perform the actual backup operations.\n\nOverall, the incremental backups configuration plays a crucial role in enabling or disabling the backup functionality within the system, ensuring that backups are only performed when explicitly allowed by the configuration settings."
