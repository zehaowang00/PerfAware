This configuration is accessed through the method `applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()`, which checks if a local variable `applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes` is set. If it is not null, the method returns this value, indicating a user-defined or overridden configuration. If the local variable is null, it falls back to a default value provided by the `DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()` method.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n- **Local Configuration Variable:** The method first checks the `applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes` variable, which allows for flexibility in configuration, enabling users to specify a custom capacity.\n- **DatabaseDescriptor Class:** If the local configuration is not set, the method relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to fetch a default capacity value. This indicates a dependency on the `DatabaseDescriptor` for providing system-wide settings.\n- **Fallback Mechanism:** The method implements a fallback mechanism, ensuring that the application can still operate with a predefined capacity even if the custom configuration is not provided.\n\nThis configuration is essential for managing the application's messaging capabilities between nodes, ensuring that the system can handle inter-node communication effectively."
