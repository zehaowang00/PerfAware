This configuration is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor.getCorruptedTombstoneStrategy()` method and influences the behavior of the system when it encounters invalid deletions in the data.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` is to define the response mechanism when corrupted tombstones are detected during data validation processes. The strategy can be set to one of three states: `disabled`, `exception`, or `warn`. \n\n- **Disabled**: No validation occurs, and any corrupted tombstones are ignored.\n- **Exception**: If invalid deletions are found, the system will throw a `CorruptSSTableException`, marking the associated SSTable as suspect to prevent it from being included in future operations, thus ensuring data integrity.\n- **Warn**: Instead of throwing an exception, the system logs a warning message when invalid deletions are detected, allowing for monitoring without immediate disruption.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions\n1. **Unfiltered Data**: The configuration interacts with the `Unfiltered` data structure, which represents data that may contain tombstones. The system checks for invalid deletions in this data based on the configured strategy.\n  \n2. **Table Metadata**: The `TableMetadata` object provides context about the structure of the data, including the keyspace and table name, which is essential for generating informative error messages when invalid data is encountered.\n\n3. **SSTableReader**: This component represents the data file being read. If the strategy dictates that an exception should be thrown, the SSTable is marked as suspect to prevent its use in future operations.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The configuration is designed to handle exceptions gracefully. If an error occurs while checking for invalid deletions or generating string representations of the data, it logs the error without failing the entire read or compaction process.\n\n#### Dependencies\nThe `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` relies on the `DatabaseDescriptor` class to retrieve its current setting. It also depends on the `Config` class, which defines the possible states of the strategy. The overall functionality is tightly integrated with the data validation processes within the database system, ensuring that data integrity is maintained while providing flexibility in handling corrupted tombstones.\n\nIn summary, the `corrupted_tombstone_strategy` configuration is a crucial component that dictates how the system responds to potential data corruption, ensuring that appropriate actions are taken to maintain data integrity while providing mechanisms for logging and error handling."
