Its primary purpose is to establish a benchmark for when GC events may be considered problematic or warrant attention.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Garbage Collector MXBeans**: The configuration interacts with the Garbage Collector Management Beans (MXBeans) that provide runtime information about the garbage collection process. These beans are queried by the `GCInspector` class during initialization.\n- **GCInspector Class**: This class is responsible for monitoring and managing the state of garbage collectors. Although the provided code does not directly reference `gc_warn_threshold_in_ms`, it is likely that this configuration would be utilized within methods of the `GCInspector` or related components to determine when to trigger warnings based on GC performance.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `gc_warn_threshold_in_ms` configuration would typically be used in conjunction with monitoring tools or alerting systems that track garbage collection metrics. If the duration of a GC event exceeds the specified threshold, it may trigger alerts or logs to inform developers or system administrators of potential issues.\n- While the current code does not implement this functionality, it is reasonable to assume that future implementations may leverage this configuration to enhance the monitoring capabilities of the garbage collection process.\n\nIn summary, `gc_warn_threshold_in_ms` serves as a critical configuration parameter for establishing a threshold for garbage collection warnings, facilitating proactive monitoring and management of the system's memory management processes."
