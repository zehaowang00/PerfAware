This configuration is crucial for managing how long the system will wait for a connection to be established before timing out.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **Method `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**:\n   - This method checks if a local variable `tcpConnectTimeoutInMS` is set. If it is not null, it returns this value. Otherwise, it retrieves the default timeout value from the `DatabaseDescriptor` class using the method `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`.\n   - This allows for flexibility, enabling the system to use a custom timeout if specified, or fall back to a default value.\n\n2. **Method `getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()`**:\n   - This method directly accesses the `DatabaseDescriptor` to obtain the internode TCP connection timeout value. It acts as a straightforward accessor for the default configuration.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is a key component that holds the default configuration values for various system parameters, including the internode TCP connect timeout. The interaction with `DatabaseDescriptor` ensures that the system has a reliable source for default configurations.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The timeout configuration is likely utilized in network communication processes between nodes, ensuring that connections do not hang indefinitely. By providing a configurable timeout, the system can adapt to different operational environments or requirements, enhancing its robustness in handling network connectivity.\n\nOverall, the `internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` configuration plays a vital role in defining network behavior within the system, ensuring that connections are managed effectively while allowing for customization based on specific needs."
