This configuration specifies the memory pool size allocated for managing index summaries, which are essential for optimizing data retrieval and storage operations.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Memory Pool Size**: The configuration determines the size of the memory pool in megabytes that the `IndexSummaryManager` will utilize. This is critical for ensuring that the manager has sufficient resources to handle index summaries effectively.\n- **Initialization Logging**: During the initialization of the `IndexSummaryManager`, the size of the memory pool is logged for informational purposes, providing visibility into the configuration being applied.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **`DatabaseDescriptor`**: This class is responsible for retrieving the configuration value for `index_summary_capacity_in_mb`. It acts as a centralized source for configuration settings related to the database, ensuring that the `IndexSummaryManager` is initialized with the correct parameters.\n- **`setMemoryPoolCapacityInMB` Method**: This method is invoked to set the actual memory pool capacity based on the value retrieved from `DatabaseDescriptor`. It directly influences the operational capacity of the `IndexSummaryManager`.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration interacts primarily with the `DatabaseDescriptor` and the `IndexSummaryManager`. By fetching the configuration value from `DatabaseDescriptor`, it ensures that the `IndexSummaryManager` is aligned with the overall database settings. This alignment is essential for maintaining consistency across the system's memory management strategies.\n\nIn summary, the `index_summary_capacity_in_mb` configuration is vital for defining the operational capacity of the `IndexSummaryManager`, facilitating efficient memory management for index summaries, and ensuring that the system operates within its defined resource limits."
