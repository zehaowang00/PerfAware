            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `key_cache_size_in_mb` directly influences the memory capacity allocated to the key cache, which can significantly affect the system's performance. A larger cache size allows for more data to be stored in memory, reducing the need for time-consuming disk I/O operations when retrieving cached entries. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to frequent cache misses and increased latency as the system retrieves data from slower storage. Given that cache performance is critical for overall system efficiency, particularly in high-load scenarios, this configuration can lead to substantial variations in performance based on its value."
