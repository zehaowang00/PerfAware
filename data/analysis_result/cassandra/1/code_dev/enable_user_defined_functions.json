This configuration is defined in the `cassandra.yaml` file and is accessed through the `DatabaseDescriptor` class.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `enable_user_defined_functions` setting is to control the availability of user-defined functions in the Cassandra database. When set to `true`, it allows users to create and execute custom functions, enhancing the database's functionality and flexibility.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `assertUdfsEnabled(String language)` checks the status of the `enable_user_defined_functions` configuration.\n- If UDFs are disabled (i.e., the configuration is set to `false`), the method throws an `InvalidRequestException`, indicating that users must enable this feature in the `cassandra.yaml` file by setting `enable_user_defined_functions=true`.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- This configuration directly interacts with the `DatabaseDescriptor` class, which serves as a centralized point for accessing various configuration settings within the Cassandra system.\n- The method also checks for the `language` parameter to determine if the requested function type is supported. If the language is not Java and scripted UDFs are disabled (controlled by another configuration), it raises a different exception, indicating the need for additional configuration.\n\nOverall, the `enable_user_defined_functions` setting is essential for enabling custom functionality in Cassandra, and its proper configuration is critical for users who wish to leverage user-defined functions in their applications."
