This timeout is crucial for ensuring that the system can handle operations efficiently and can respond to issues without hanging indefinitely.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `getTruncateRpcTimeout()` retrieves the configured truncate timeout value in milliseconds from the `DatabaseDescriptor`, which centralizes configuration management.\n- The method `getMinRpcTimeout(TimeUnit unit)` aggregates various timeout configurations (including truncate) to determine the minimum timeout across different operations, ensuring that the system adheres to the most restrictive timeout setting.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **DatabaseDescriptor**: This class is responsible for managing and providing access to various configuration settings, including the truncate timeout.\n- **TimeUnit**: The configuration interacts with this enumeration to convert timeout values into different time units (e.g., milliseconds, nanoseconds) as needed by the system.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `get()` method utilizes the `truncate_request_timeout_in_ms` configuration to determine how long to wait for a truncate operation to complete.

If this timeout is set too low, it can lead to frequent timeouts and retries, which can degrade system performance significantly. Conversely, if set too high, it can cause the system to hang on operations that are failing, leading to resource contention and inefficient use of system resources.
