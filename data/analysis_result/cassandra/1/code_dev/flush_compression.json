            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `flush_compression` configuration directly impacts the throughput of the compressor during flush operations, which can significantly affect system performance. If the flush compression is set to `none`, it disables compression entirely, potentially leading to increased I/O operations and longer write times. Conversely, if set to `fast`, it can optimize the flushing process by utilizing a faster compression algorithm, which is critical for maintaining write throughput, especially for large tables. The potential for flushes to queue up and block writes underscores the importance of this configuration in managing time-intensive operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
