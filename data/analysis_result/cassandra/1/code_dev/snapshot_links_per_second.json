This method is crucial for other parts of the system that require knowledge of the allowed rate for processing snapshot links, ensuring that the system adheres to the defined limits.\n\nOverall, this configuration plays a vital role in controlling the flow of snapshot link processing by providing a configurable parameter that can be adjusted as needed, facilitating flexibility and maintainability within the system."
