Its primary purpose is to determine whether the system should collect and utilize information about repaired data when querying sub-ranges of data across multiple replicas.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n1. **DatabaseDescriptor**: This component is responsible for providing the configuration value through the method `getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()`. This method returns a boolean indicating whether repaired data tracking is enabled.\n\n2. **Query Method**: The configuration directly influences the `query` method, which handles the querying of a specified sub-range. Within this method, the configuration is checked to decide if repaired data tracking should be activated. Specifically, it assesses whether there are multiple full replicas available to compare results.\n\n3. **ReplicaPlan**: The `replicaPlan` parameter in the `query` method outlines the replicas involved in the read operation. The configuration interacts with this component to filter and determine the number of full replicas that can provide repaired data tracking information.\n\n4. **DataResolver and ReadRepair**: If the configuration allows for tracking, the system creates instances of `DataResolver` and `ReadRepair`, which are responsible for managing the read operation and ensuring that repaired data is appropriately handled.\n\n5. **ReadCallback**: The configuration also affects the instantiation of `ReadCallback`, which is used to handle the responses from the read operations, ensuring that any repaired data tracking is processed correctly.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts with the messaging system to send read commands to replicas, ensuring that the appropriate tracking information is included based on whether the configuration is enabled.\n- It plays a role in the decision-making process when determining how to handle read requests, particularly in scenarios where multiple queries are executed in parallel.\n\nIn summary, the `repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled` configuration is essential for enabling the system to effectively track and manage repaired data during range read operations, influencing various components involved in querying and data resolution."
