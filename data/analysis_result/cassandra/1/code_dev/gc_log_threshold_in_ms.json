Although the provided code does not explicitly reference or utilize this configuration, its purpose can be inferred based on typical usage patterns in garbage collection monitoring.\n\n#### Purpose:\n- The `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` configuration serves as a threshold to determine when to log GC events based on their duration. This allows the system to selectively log significant GC events that exceed the specified time, aiding in monitoring and analysis.\n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n- **Garbage Collector (GC) MBeans**: The system interacts with various garbage collector MBeans through the `ManagementFactory` to gather information about GC activities. These MBeans provide metrics and statistics related to the performance and behavior of the garbage collectors in use.\n- **GCInspector Class**: This class is responsible for initializing the monitoring of garbage collection events. It queries the MBeans to retrieve details about each garbage collector and maintains their states.\n\n#### Interactions within the System:\n- While the `gc_log_threshold_in_ms` configuration is not directly manipulated in the provided code, it would typically be used in conjunction with the GC monitoring framework. The logging mechanism would check the duration of GC events against this threshold to determine whether to log the event.\n- The configuration may interact with other monitoring tools or logging frameworks that capture and report GC activities, enabling system administrators and developers to track GC performance and behavior over time.\n\nIn summary, while the code does not directly reference `gc_log_threshold_in_ms`, this configuration plays a crucial role in defining the logging behavior for garbage collection events, facilitating better monitoring and analysis of the system's memory management processes."
