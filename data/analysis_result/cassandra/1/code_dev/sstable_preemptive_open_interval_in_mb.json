Other parts of the system that require knowledge of the preemptive opening behavior will depend on this configuration.\n- **Conditional Flags**: The configuration interacts with flags like `disableEarlyOpeningForTests`, which can alter its behavior during testing scenarios.\n\nOverall, the `sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb` configuration plays a vital role in managing how SSTables are handled in memory, influencing the system's data access patterns and efficiency without directly addressing performance metrics."
