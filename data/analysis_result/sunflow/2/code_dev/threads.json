This allows for flexibility in how rendering tasks are distributed across available processing resources.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The configuration is accessed via the `options.getInt(\"threads\", 0)` method, where it attempts to read the integer value associated with the \"threads\" key. If this key is not found, it defaults to `0`, indicating that the system may choose to use a single thread or determine the number of threads dynamically based on other factors.\n- Additionally, the `lowPriority` configuration is read using `options.getBoolean(\"threads.lowPriority\", true)`, which indicates whether the rendering threads should operate at a lower priority compared to other system processes. This can help in managing system responsiveness during rendering tasks.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The `threads` configuration is dependent on the `Options` object, which must be properly initialized and populated with relevant settings before the rendering process begins.\n- It interacts closely with the rendering logic, particularly in how the `sampler` prepares and executes the rendering operation. The number of threads specified can influence the way tasks are parallelized and executed, although the exact implementation details of this interaction are abstracted away in the rendering components.\n- The configuration may also impact other components that rely on threading, such as the `lightServer`, which may utilize the threading settings to optimize its operations during rendering.\n\nIn summary, the `threads` configuration plays a crucial role in defining how rendering tasks are managed in terms of concurrency, allowing for customizable performance based on user-defined settings within the `Options` object."
