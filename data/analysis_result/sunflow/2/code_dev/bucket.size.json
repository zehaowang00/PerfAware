By segmenting the image into buckets, the system can process each section independently, facilitating more organized and efficient rendering.\n\n### Functionality:\n1. **Fetching Configuration**: The `bucket.size` value is retrieved using `options.getInt(\"bucket.size\", bucketSize)`, where it either takes the user-defined value or defaults to the previously set value of `bucketSize`.\n  \n2. **Clamping Value**: The value of `bucketSize` is then clamped between a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 512 pixels using `MathUtils.clamp()`. This ensures that the bucket size remains within a reasonable range, preventing excessively small or large buckets that could complicate processing.\n\n3. **Calculating Buckets**: The method calculates the number of buckets in both the x and y directions based on the image dimensions (`imageWidth` and `imageHeight`) and the clamped `bucketSize`. This is done using integer division, ensuring that any remaining pixels are accounted for in an additional bucket if necessary.\n\n### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- **Dependencies**: The configuration relies on the `Options` class to retrieve the `bucket.size` value and the `MathUtils` class for clamping. It also interacts with the `UI` module to display the settings.\n  \n- **Interactions with Other Components**: The calculated `bucketSize` and the number of buckets (`numBucketsX` and `numBucketsY`) are critical for the rendering process, as they dictate how the scene is divided for processing.
