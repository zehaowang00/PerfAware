    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration in the Sunflow software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the depth of reflection calculations during rendering. A higher value can lead to increased computational complexity and longer execution times, as more reflective surfaces require additional ray tracing calculations. Conversely, a lower value may reduce memory consumption and execution time but at the cost of visual fidelity. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact overall system performance, making it a critical parameter in performance tuning."
