    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration in the Sunflow software project directly influences the rendering process, particularly in how light interacts with surfaces. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in the quality of the rendered images and the computational resources required. For instance, increasing the diffuse depth may enhance the realism of the rendering but at the cost of increased execution time and memory consumption due to more complex calculations. Conversely, reducing it may lead to faster rendering times but at the expense of visual fidelity. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can notably impact overall system performance."
