A smaller bucket size may lead to a higher number of buckets, increasing the overhead of managing these buckets and potentially leading to more time-intensive operations during rendering. Conversely, a larger bucket size can reduce the number of buckets but may impact the granularity of rendering, affecting the quality of the output. Given that rendering is typically a time-consuming operation, variations in `bucket.size` can lead to substantial performance differences, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
