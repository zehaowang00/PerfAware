    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration in the Sunflow software project directly influences the level of detail and accuracy in rendering reflective surfaces. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, as higher depths require more computational resources for ray tracing and can increase memory consumption due to the need for storing additional data structures. Therefore, adjustments to this setting can notably impact overall system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
