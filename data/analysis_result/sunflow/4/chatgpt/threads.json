    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'threads' configuration in the Sunflow software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the level of parallelism in rendering tasks. Increasing the number of threads can significantly reduce execution time by allowing multiple rendering operations to occur simultaneously, effectively utilizing available CPU resources. Conversely, setting the number of threads too high can lead to context switching overhead and increased memory consumption, which can degrade performance. Therefore, changes to the 'threads' configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
