    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration in the Sunflow project directly influences the rendering quality and computational complexity of light interactions in the scene. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, as higher refraction depths require more calculations for light paths, which can increase memory consumption and processing time. This sensitivity to configuration changes indicates that it is performance-sensitive, as it can notably affect overall system performance."
