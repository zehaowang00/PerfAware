The justification is comprehensive, explaining how increasing the reflection depth can lead to an exponential rise in ray tracing calculations, which are time-intensive and can significantly affect rendering speed and memory usage. This aligns with the understanding that configurations influencing computational complexity in rendering tasks are critical for performance evaluation. The analysis is persuasive and well-supported, addressing the potential for performance degradation in complex scenes effectively."
