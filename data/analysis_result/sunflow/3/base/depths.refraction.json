The operations involved, such as checking for the presence of keys in a map and performing basic arithmetic calculations, do not constitute time-intensive or memory-heavy operations. The impact on performance is minimal, as these actions do not lead to significant variations in processing time or memory usage, especially when compared to configurations that involve complex computations or extensive resource allocations.

The justification highlights that increasing the refraction depth leads to more complex light calculations, which can significantly affect rendering speed and memory usage. This comprehensive assessment aligns with the understanding that configurations influencing computational complexity and resource allocation are critical for performance sensitivity. The analysis is clear, persuasive, and accurately reflects the potential performance impacts associated with this configuration."
