    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration in the Sunflow software project directly influences how data is partitioned and processed during rendering tasks. A smaller bucket size can lead to increased overhead due to more frequent memory allocation and management, while a larger bucket size may reduce the granularity of parallel processing, potentially leading to longer execution times. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly affect execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
