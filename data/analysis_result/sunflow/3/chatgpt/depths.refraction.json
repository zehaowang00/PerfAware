    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration in the Sunflow project directly influences the rendering quality and computational complexity of light interactions in the scene. Changes to this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, as higher refraction depths require more calculations for light paths, resulting in increased memory consumption and longer rendering times. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
