This setting directly affects the realism of the rendered scene by controlling the complexity of light interactions.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The configuration is read using the method `options.getInt(\"depths.reflection\", maxReflectionDepth)`, which retrieves the value associated with the key `depths.reflection`. If the key is not found, it defaults to the current value of `maxReflectionDepth`.\n- After retrieval, the value is validated to ensure it is non-negative using `Math.max(0, maxReflectionDepth)`. This ensures that the system does not attempt to process a negative reflection depth, which would be nonsensical in the context of ray tracing.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The `maxReflectionDepth` variable is likely used in subsequent rendering calculations, influencing how light rays are traced through the scene. It interacts with other components of the rendering engine, such as the global illumination (GI) engine and the light sampling mechanisms.\n- The configuration is part of a broader set of parameters that include similar depth settings for diffuse and refraction rays, indicating a cohesive design where multiple depth configurations work together to define the overall rendering quality and behavior.\n\nIn summary, `depths.reflection` is a key configuration that governs the reflection depth in the rendering process, ensuring that the system can manage light interactions effectively while maintaining a clear and validated parameter structure."

Higher reflection depths result in more complex calculations and increased computational load, as each additional reflection requires additional ray tracing operations. This can lead to time-intensive operations during rendering, particularly in scenes with many reflective surfaces, thereby impacting overall system performance substantially."
