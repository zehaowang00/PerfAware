The default value for `threads` is set to `0`, indicating that if no specific value is provided, the system may operate in a single-threaded mode or use a predefined default behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the `lowPriority` configuration, which is also extracted from the `options`, indicates whether the rendering threads should operate at a low priority. This setting allows the system to manage resource allocation more flexibly, potentially allowing other processes to take precedence over the rendering tasks.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n- **Options Object**: The `options` object is a critical component that encapsulates various configuration settings, including `threads` and `lowPriority`. It acts as the interface through which these configurations are accessed.\n- **Rendering Process**: The `threads` configuration directly influences how the rendering tasks are executed. A higher number of threads can facilitate concurrent processing, while the `lowPriority` setting can affect how these threads interact with other system processes.\n- **System Dependencies**: The rendering engine relies on the values of `threads` and `lowPriority` to optimize its execution strategy. These settings may interact with other components such as the `sampler` and `lightServer`, which may also depend on the threading model to perform their tasks effectively.\n\nIn summary, the `threads` configuration plays a vital role in defining the concurrency model of the rendering process, while the `lowPriority` setting provides additional control over resource management during execution.
