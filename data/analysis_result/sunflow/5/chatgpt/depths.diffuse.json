    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration in the Sunflow software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the quality and complexity of the rendering process. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in execution time, as it affects how light diffusion is calculated in the rendering pipeline. A higher value may result in more accurate light interactions, increasing computational load and memory usage, while a lower value may reduce rendering quality but improve performance. Therefore, adjustments to this setting can have a notable impact on both execution time and resource consumption."
