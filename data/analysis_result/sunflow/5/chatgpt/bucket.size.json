    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration in the Sunflow software project is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the efficiency of memory usage and the speed of rendering processes. A larger bucket size can lead to increased memory consumption, while a smaller bucket size may result in more frequent memory allocation and deallocation, which can significantly impact execution time. Variations in bucket size can cause notable changes in how data is processed and stored, affecting overall system performance during rendering tasks."
