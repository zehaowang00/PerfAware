    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration in the Sunflow software project directly influences the level of detail in the rendering process. Changes to this configuration can significantly impact the computational workload, as higher reflection depths require more calculations and memory for ray tracing. This can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive option."
