A higher reflection depth can significantly increase the computational complexity and time required for rendering, as it allows more light interactions to be calculated. This can lead to substantial performance variations, especially in scenes with complex lighting and reflective surfaces. Therefore, it is critical to consider this configuration's impact on performance, making it performance-sensitive."
