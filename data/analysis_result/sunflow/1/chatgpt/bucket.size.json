    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration in the Sunflow project directly influences how data is partitioned and processed during rendering tasks. A smaller bucket size can lead to increased overhead due to more frequent memory allocation and management, while a larger bucket size may reduce overhead but can lead to inefficient memory usage and longer execution times if the buckets become too large to process effectively. Therefore, changing the 'bucket.size' value can significantly impact both execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
