    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration in the Sunflow software project directly influences the level of detail in the rendering process. Changes to this value can significantly affect the computational complexity of ray tracing, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption. A higher depth value increases the number of reflection rays calculated, which can exponentially increase processing time and memory usage, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
