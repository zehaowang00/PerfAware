This indicates that if no specific thread count is provided, the system will default to a single-threaded operation.\n- Additionally, the `lowPriority` configuration is also read from the `Options` object, indicating whether the threads should run at a lower priority. This can be useful in scenarios where the rendering process should not interfere significantly with other system processes.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The `threads` configuration is dependent on the `Options` object, which encapsulates various settings that can be adjusted at runtime. This allows for flexible configuration management.\n- The value of `threads` directly influences how the rendering sampler prepares and executes rendering tasks. It interacts with the `sampler` component, which is responsible for rendering images based on the specified configuration.\n- The `lowPriority` setting may also affect how the rendering threads interact with the system's resource management, potentially allowing other high-priority tasks to execute more smoothly.\n\nIn summary, the `threads` configuration is integral to managing the concurrency of rendering operations, providing flexibility in how rendering tasks are executed and allowing for adjustments based on user-defined settings within the `Options` object."
