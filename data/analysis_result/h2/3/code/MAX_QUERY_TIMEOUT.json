While timeouts can influence the responsiveness of database queries, the operation of setting a timeout itself is not inherently time-intensive or memory-intensive. It does not directly lead to significant performance variations in the system's overall operation, as it merely sets a parameter without affecting the execution of queries or consuming substantial resources."
