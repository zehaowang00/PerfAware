If this configuration is set to a high value, it could lead to substantial increases in the computed cost, potentially causing performance degradation in scenarios where this method is invoked frequently or in a time-sensitive context. The reliance on this configuration for determining row counts indicates that it can have a major impact on performance, especially in large datasets or complex queries."
