This configuration is particularly relevant in scenarios where the table does not support direct row count retrieval, such as virtual tables.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is to provide a default estimate for the number of rows in a table, ensuring that the system can continue to function smoothly even when precise data is unavailable.\n- It is accessed within the `getCost` method, which calculates the cost of operations based on the expected number of rows.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is part of the broader database settings, which are accessed via the `database.getSettings()` method. This indicates that it relies on the database's configuration management system.\n- **Table Interface**: The method checks if the table can provide an accurate row count through `table.canGetRowCount(session)`. If it can, the actual count is used; otherwise, the estimated value is utilized.\n- **Session Management**: The `SessionLocal` parameter indicates that the configuration may be influenced by the current session context, ensuring that different sessions can have different settings if necessary.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `getCost` method integrates the `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` configuration into the cost calculation process, which is essential for query planning and execution.\n- By providing an estimated row count, this configuration allows the system to maintain operational continuity and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and query execution paths.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` plays a critical role in the system's ability to handle scenarios where precise data is unavailable, ensuring that the overall functionality remains intact while interacting with various components such as the database settings and table interfaces."
