This configuration determines the number of sample rows to be used during the analysis process, specifically retrieved via `session.getDatabase().getSettings().analyzeSample`. \n\n#### Purpose and Functionality\nThe primary purpose of the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is to define the sample size that will guide the analysis of tables within the database. When the `analyzeTables` method is invoked, it checks if there are tables to analyze and if the current thread holds the necessary lock. If these conditions are met, it proceeds to analyze the tables.\n\nThe method creates a local copy of the tables to analyze and clears the original reference to prevent concurrent modifications. The sample size for each table analysis is determined by dividing the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` value by 10, which is then used in the `Analyze.analyzeTable` method to perform the actual analysis on each table.\n\n#### Dependencies and Key Components\n- **SessionLocal**: The `Analyze` constructor takes a `SessionLocal` object, which provides access to the current session's database settings, including the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE`.\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is dependent on the database settings, specifically the `analyzeSample` property, which is essential for determining the sample size for analysis.\n- **Table**: The analysis is performed on instances of the `Table` class, which represent the database tables being analyzed.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System\nThe `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration interacts with the database's settings and the `Analyze` class methods. It influences how many rows are sampled during the analysis of each table, thereby affecting the overall analysis process. The `analyzeTables` method also interacts with the database's locking mechanism to ensure thread safety during the analysis operation and commits any changes made during the analysis.\n\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is a key component that dictates the sample size for table analysis, ensuring that the analysis process is conducted in a controlled manner while interacting with various components of the system, including session management and table representation."

A higher sample size can lead to significantly longer execution times and increased memory usage, especially when analyzing large tables. This can result in substantial performance variations, as the analysis process can become time-intensive and memory-heavy, particularly in systems with large datasets. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a critical impact on overall system performance."
