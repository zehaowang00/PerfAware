If the database is not available (i.e., it is closed), an exception is thrown, indicating a broken connection.\n  \n2. **Modification Metadata**: The method compares the `modificationMetaId` of the current statement against the database's `modificationMetaId`.

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` configuration can lead to significant performance degradation because it forces the recompilation of SQL statements every time they are executed, regardless of whether the underlying database structure has changed. This can result in time-intensive operations, especially for frequently executed statements, as recompilation involves parsing and optimizing the SQL, which is resource-intensive. The potential for increased CPU usage and memory consumption during these recompilation processes can substantially impact overall system performance, particularly in high-load scenarios."
