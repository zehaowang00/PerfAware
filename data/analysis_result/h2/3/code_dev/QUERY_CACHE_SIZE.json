This allows the application to efficiently reuse previously executed queries, thereby reducing the need to re-execute them against the database.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database**: The `Database` object is a central component that provides access to various settings, including the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE`. It acts as a source of configuration data for the session.\n- **Settings**: The `Settings` class or structure within the `Database` encapsulates various configuration parameters, including `queryCacheSize`.\n\n#### Interactions:\nWhen a `SessionLocal` instance is created, it initializes its `queryCacheSize` attribute by accessing the `Database` settings. This establishes a direct dependency on the `Database` and its settings, meaning that any changes to the cache size in the `Database` will directly affect how the `SessionLocal` operates. \n\nOverall, the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` configuration is essential for managing query execution efficiency within the session, enabling the application to optimize its interaction with the database through effective caching strategies."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` directly influences the efficiency of query execution by determining how much query result data can be cached. A larger cache can significantly reduce the number of time-intensive database queries executed, thereby improving overall system performance. Conversely, a poorly sized cache can lead to excessive memory usage or cache misses, resulting in slower performance. Given that caching strategies can have substantial impacts on both execution time and memory consumption, this configuration is classified as performance sensitive."
