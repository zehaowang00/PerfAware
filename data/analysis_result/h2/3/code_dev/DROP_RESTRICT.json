This is controlled by the `dropRestrict` setting retrieved from the database's configuration settings.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- When `dropRestrict` is set to `true`, the system opts for `ConstraintActionType.RESTRICT`, which prevents the drop operation if there are existing dependencies on the object being dropped.\n- Conversely, if `dropRestrict` is set to `false`, the system uses `ConstraintActionType.CASCADE`, allowing the drop operation to proceed and automatically removing any dependent objects.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SessionLocal**: Represents the current session context, providing access to the database and its settings.\n- **Schema**: Represents the database schema that may contain the objects being manipulated.\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration settings that include `dropRestrict`, which influence the behavior of drop operations.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `DROP_RESTRICT` configuration interacts with various classes responsible for drop operations:\n- **DropView**, **DropTable**, **DropDomain**, **DropSchema**, and **AlterTableDropConstraint**: Each of these classes checks the `dropRestrict` setting to determine the appropriate `dropAction` to apply during their respective operations.\n- The decision made based on the `dropRestrict` setting ensures that the integrity of the database is maintained by either enforcing restrictions or allowing cascading deletions as per the configuration.\n\nOverall, the `DROP_RESTRICT` configuration is integral to managing how the system handles the removal of database objects, ensuring that the operations align with the intended database integrity and dependency management policies."
