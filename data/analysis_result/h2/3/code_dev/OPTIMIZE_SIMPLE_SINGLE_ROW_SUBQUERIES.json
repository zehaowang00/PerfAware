If this setting is enabled, the system will attempt to optimize the query further.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\n- **Expression Handling**: The method retrieves an expression representing a single-row subquery through `query.getIfSingleRow()`. If this expression meets certain criteria (checked via `isEverything`), it undergoes further optimization.\n- **ExpressionVisitor**: The `ExpressionVisitor` is utilized to manage the query level, allowing for a decrement in the query context as it processes the outer resolvers.\n- **Type Setting**: The method concludes by resetting the `outerResolvers` and setting the type of the expression, ensuring that the optimized expression is returned for further processing.\n\nIn summary, the `OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES` configuration facilitates the optimization of single-row subqueries by leveraging session context, query preparation, and specific database settings, thereby enhancing the overall query handling mechanism within the system."
