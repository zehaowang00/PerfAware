It is defined as a property within the database settings, accessed through `database.getSettings().maxQueryTimeout`. This configuration serves as an upper limit for the `queryTimeout` parameter that can be set for database queries.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- The primary purpose of `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT` is to ensure that the timeout for database queries does not exceed a predefined maximum value. This helps maintain control over query execution times and prevents excessively long-running queries that could impact system stability.\n- When the `setQueryTimeout(int queryTimeout)` method is invoked, it first retrieves the maximum allowable timeout from the database settings. If the provided `queryTimeout` exceeds this maximum or is set to zero (indicating no timeout), the method adjusts the `queryTimeout` to the maximum value.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `database.getSettings()` method to fetch the `maxQueryTimeout` value, which is critical for enforcing the timeout limit.\n- **Query Timeout Variable**: The `queryTimeout` variable is updated based on the validation against `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT`, ensuring that it adheres to the defined constraints.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `setQueryTimeout` method interacts directly with the database settings to enforce the timeout limit. It is likely called by other components of the system that manage database interactions, ensuring that all queries adhere to the configured timeout constraints.\n- Additionally, the method resets the `cancelAtNs` variable to zero, which may be involved in managing the cancellation of ongoing queries, indicating that the timeout setting is closely tied to query execution management.\n\nIn summary, the `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT` configuration is essential for maintaining controlled query execution times, ensuring that the system operates within defined limits and interacts seamlessly with other components managing database operations."
