This configuration is accessed through the `database.getSettings().lobTimeout` method, which retrieves the timeout value in seconds.\n\n**Key Components and Dependencies:**\n- **Temporary Result LOBs:** The method `removeTemporaryLobs` operates on a collection called `temporaryResultLobs`, which holds instances of `TimeoutValue`. Each `TimeoutValue` contains a timestamp indicating when the LOB was created.\n- **ValueLob:** The `ValueLob` class represents the actual LOB data. The method checks if a `ValueLob` is linked to a table before removing it, ensuring that only unlinked LOBs are cleared from memory.\n- **Database Settings:** The configuration relies on the `database` object to access the settings, indicating a dependency on the database management layer for configuration retrieval.\n\n**Interaction with Other Parts of the System:**\nThe `removeTemporaryLobs` method is invoked to manage memory by removing LOBs that exceed the specified timeout. It checks the age of each `TimeoutValue` against the current time minus the `LOB_TIMEOUT` value, allowing for conditional removal based on whether a timeout event has occurred. This interaction ensures that the system maintains efficient use of resources by cleaning up temporary LOBs that are no longer needed.\n\nIn summary, the `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration is essential for controlling the lifecycle of temporary LOBs, facilitating resource management and ensuring that the system does not retain unnecessary data beyond its useful life."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration directly influences the memory management of temporary LOBs, which can have significant performance implications. If the timeout is set too high, unlinked LOBs may remain in memory longer than necessary, leading to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation due to excessive garbage collection or memory pressure. Conversely, a low timeout may lead to frequent removals, which could also impact performance if the system needs to recreate these LOBs frequently. Thus, the configuration can cause substantial variations in system performance based on its value."
