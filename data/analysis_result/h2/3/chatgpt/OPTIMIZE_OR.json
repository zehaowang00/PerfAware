    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution plans and performance. Changing this setting can lead to variations in how the database optimizes logical operations, which in turn affects execution time and resource utilization. If the optimization is not aligned with the specific workload characteristics, it can result in increased memory consumption and longer query response times, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
