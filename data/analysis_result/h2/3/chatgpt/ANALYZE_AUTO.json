    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'ANALYZE_AUTO' in the H2 database significantly impacts performance because it controls whether the database automatically analyzes tables for performance optimization. If set to 'true', the system may incur additional overhead during data modifications, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption due to the background analysis processes. Conversely, setting it to 'false' can reduce resource usage but may lead to suboptimal query performance over time as the database may not optimize its execution plans effectively. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in overall system performance."
