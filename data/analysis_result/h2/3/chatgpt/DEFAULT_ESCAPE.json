    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration in the H2 database affects how special characters are handled in SQL queries. Changes to this setting can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in scenarios involving complex queries or large datasets where escaping characters is critical for query parsing and execution. If the escape mechanism is not optimized or is misconfigured, it can result in increased memory consumption and longer execution times due to additional processing overhead. Therefore, this configuration is deemed performance-sensitive."
