    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration in the H2 database significantly influences how data is stored and accessed. Different table engines can lead to varying execution times for queries and impact memory consumption based on their underlying implementation. For instance, switching from a memory-based engine to a disk-based engine can drastically alter performance characteristics, especially under heavy load or with large datasets. This sensitivity to configuration changes makes DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE a performance-sensitive option."
