    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration in the H2 database significantly influences the number of concurrent connections that can be handled by the system. A change in this value can lead to variations in resource allocation, such as memory usage and CPU load, which directly impacts execution time for queries and overall system throughput. If the number of connections exceeds the optimal threshold, it can lead to contention for resources, increased latency, and potential system instability, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
