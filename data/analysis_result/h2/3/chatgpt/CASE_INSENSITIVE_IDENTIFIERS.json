    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS' in the H2 database can significantly affect system performance because it alters how the database engine processes queries and manages identifiers. When this option is enabled, the database must perform additional checks to ensure that identifier comparisons are case-insensitive, which can lead to increased execution time for queries that involve identifier lookups. This change can also impact memory consumption as the database may need to maintain additional data structures to handle case-insensitivity, resulting in variations in resource usage depending on the workload. Therefore, changing this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
