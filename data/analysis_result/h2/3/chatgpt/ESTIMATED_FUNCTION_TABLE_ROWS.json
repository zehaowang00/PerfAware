    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' in the H2 database can significantly impact query optimization and execution plans. A change in this value can lead to variations in how the database engine estimates the number of rows returned by a function, which in turn affects the choice of execution strategy. If the estimation is inaccurate, it can result in suboptimal query plans, leading to increased execution time and higher memory consumption during query processing. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly influences the efficiency of database operations."
