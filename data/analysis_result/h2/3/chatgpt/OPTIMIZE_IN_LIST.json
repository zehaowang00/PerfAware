    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance, especially for operations involving large datasets. Enabling this optimization can reduce the time complexity of list operations by improving how data is accessed and processed. Conversely, disabling it may lead to increased execution times and higher memory consumption due to less efficient data handling. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
