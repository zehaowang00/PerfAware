    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The REUSE_SPACE configuration in the H2 database affects how memory is allocated and reused for various operations. Changes to this setting can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and garbage collection behavior, which in turn can impact execution time and overall system performance. If the reuse space is too small, it may lead to increased memory allocation and deallocation overhead, causing longer execution times. Conversely, if it is too large, it may lead to inefficient memory usage, potentially causing the system to run out of memory or degrade performance due to excessive garbage collection. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
