It specifically determines the number of rows to be sampled during the analysis, which is critical for generating insights about the data distribution and performance characteristics of the tables.\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - The primary purpose of the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is to define how many rows should be sampled when analyzing database tables. This setting is accessed through the `getSettings()` method of the database context, which retrieves the configuration values.\\n\\n2. **Key Components**:\\n   - **Analyze Class**: The `Analyze` class utilizes the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` setting to initialize the `sampleRows` variable in its constructor. This variable is then used in the `analyzeTables` method to determine how many rows to sample for each table analysis.\\n   - **Database Settings**: The `getSettings()` method from the database context is responsible for retrieving the `analyzeSample` value. This method interacts with various settings related to database connections and configurations.\\n\\n3. **Interactions**:\\n   - The `analyzeTables` method in the `Analyze` class interacts with the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration by using it to calculate the number of rows to analyze (`rowCount`). This is done by dividing the `analyzeSample` value by 10, which influences the granularity of the analysis performed on each table.\\n   - The configuration is indirectly involved in the transaction management process, as the results of the analysis may lead to further actions or adjustments in the database state.\\n\\n4. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration relies on the overall database settings, which are loaded and managed through the `getSettings()` methods. These methods ensure that the necessary connection information and configuration values are available for the analysis process.\\n\\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is integral to the table analysis functionality within the system, guiding how data is sampled and analyzed, while interacting with various components responsible for database settings and operations.\"}"
