The justification provided highlights the potential for significant performance variations based on the complexity of queries and the efficiency of the optimization process. The reliance on methods like `query.prepare()` and `query.getIfSingleRow()` further supports the conclusion, as these operations can be time-intensive, especially in scenarios involving complex or large datasets. Overall, the analysis is comprehensive and accurately reflects the performance implications of the configuration."
