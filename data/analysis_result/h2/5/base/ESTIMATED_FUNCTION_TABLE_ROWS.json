This configuration is particularly relevant in scenarios where the database table does not support accurate row counting.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Row Count Estimation**: The configuration serves as a fallback mechanism for estimating the number of rows in a table. When the method `getCost` determines that an accurate row count cannot be obtained via `table.canGetRowCount(session)`, it retrieves the value of `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` from the database settings. This allows the system to continue with cost calculations even in the absence of precise data.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is accessed through the `database.getSettings()` method, which is responsible for retrieving various settings related to the database environment. This method interacts with the `DbSettings` class, which encapsulates configuration parameters, including `estimatedFunctionTableRows`.\n- **Connection Info**: The method `getSettings()` also highlights the interaction with connection information objects, which may influence how settings are loaded and managed within the system. This includes loading properties from configuration files or initializing default settings when no properties are found.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` configuration interacts with the cost estimation logic in the `getCost` method. By providing a default value for row counts, it ensures that the system can still perform cost calculations for queries, maintaining operational continuity even when precise data is not available.\n- The configuration is part of a broader settings management system that includes methods for loading properties and managing connection information, indicating its integration within the overall architecture of the database management system.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is a vital configuration parameter that aids in maintaining the functionality of query cost estimation when exact row counts cannot be determined, thereby ensuring the robustness of the system's performance in various scenarios."
