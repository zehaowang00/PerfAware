This value dictates how many rows will be sampled from each table during the analysis.\\n   - The method checks for tables that need to be analyzed and ensures that the current thread holds a lock to prevent concurrent modifications. It then iterates over the tables, invoking the `analyzeTable` method for each one with the calculated `rowCount`.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The `analyzeSample` configuration relies on the `getSettings` method from the database session to retrieve the appropriate settings. This method interacts with various components, such as `ConnectionInfo` objects and property loading mechanisms, to ensure that the correct settings are available for the analysis.\\n\\n4. **Interaction with Other Components**:\\n   - The `analyzeTables` method interacts with the database's metadata and transaction management by unlocking metadata after analysis and committing any changes made during the analysis process. This ensures that the analysis is conducted safely and that the results are accurately reflected in the database state.\\n\\nOverall, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration plays a crucial role in guiding the analysis of database tables, ensuring that the process is both systematic and based on a defined sample size, while also interacting with various components of the database management system to retrieve necessary settings and manage transactions.\"}"

The calculation of `rowCount` as one-tenth of `analyzeSample` and the subsequent analysis of potentially large tables can lead to substantial variations in execution time, especially if the sample size is large or if the tables being analyzed contain a significant amount of data. This can result in increased memory usage and longer processing times, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
