It determines the number of sample rows to be used during the analysis of database tables. This configuration is accessed via the `session.getDatabase().getSettings().analyzeSample` call in the constructor of the `Analyze` class.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **SessionLocal**: The `Analyze` class is initialized with a `SessionLocal` object, which provides context and access to the database settings.\n- **Database Settings**: The `analyzeSample` value is part of the database settings, indicating how many rows should be sampled for analysis.\n- **Tables to Analyze**: The configuration interacts with a collection of tables (`tablesToAnalyze`) that are marked for analysis. The analysis process is contingent upon this collection being non-null and properly locked to prevent concurrent modifications.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `analyzeTables` method utilizes the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration to determine the number of rows to sample for each table being analyzed. Specifically, it divides the `analyzeSample` value by 10 to derive the `rowCount` for each table.\n- The method iterates over the `tablesToAnalyzeLocal` set, performing the analysis for each table using the `Analyze.analyzeTable` method, which is responsible for executing the actual analysis logic.\n- After completing the analysis, the method ensures that any necessary database locks are released and commits any changes made during the analysis process.\n\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is essential for guiding the sampling process during table analysis, ensuring that the analysis is conducted in a controlled manner while interacting with various components of the database system."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the number of rows sampled during the analysis of database tables. A higher sample size can lead to significantly longer analysis times, especially for large tables, resulting in time-intensive operations that can impact overall system performance. The analysis process involves iterating over potentially many tables and performing operations that may lock database resources and open new transactions, which can further exacerbate performance issues if the sample size is large. Thus, variations in this configuration can lead to substantial performance differences."
