This configuration is particularly relevant in scenarios where the table's row count cannot be determined due to its nature as a virtual table or other constraints.\n\n#### Purpose:\n- The primary purpose of `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is to provide an estimated count of rows, ensuring that the system can proceed with calculations that depend on this information, such as cost estimation for query planning.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is accessed through the `database.getSettings()` method, indicating that it is part of the broader database configuration settings.\n- **Table Object**: The `table` object interacts with this configuration by checking if it can retrieve the actual row count. If it cannot, it defaults to using the estimated value.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The configuration interacts with the `getCost` method, which is responsible for calculating the cost of executing a query. If the table can provide an accurate row count, that value is used; otherwise, the `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` configuration is utilized.\n- This mechanism ensures that the system has a consistent approach to estimating row counts, which is crucial for query optimization and planning.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` plays a vital role in maintaining the functionality of the system by providing a reliable estimate of row counts when direct access is not possible, thereby facilitating smoother query execution and planning processes."
