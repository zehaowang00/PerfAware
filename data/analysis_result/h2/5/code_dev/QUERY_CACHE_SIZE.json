This configuration is derived from the `Database` object, specifically through its `getSettings()` method, which encapsulates various database settings.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` configuration determines the amount of memory allocated for caching query results. This allows the system to store frequently accessed data, thereby facilitating quicker retrieval during subsequent requests.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database**: The `Database` object is a primary dependency that provides access to various settings, including `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE`. It serves as the source of configuration data.\n- **Settings**: The `getSettings()` method of the `Database` class returns a settings object that contains the `queryCacheSize` attribute, which is directly assigned to the `queryCacheSize` field in the `SessionLocal` class.\n\n#### Interactions:\nThe `queryCacheSize` configuration interacts with the session management functionalities by influencing how data is cached and retrieved during a user's session. When a new `SessionLocal` instance is created, it initializes this configuration based on the current database settings, ensuring that the session operates with the appropriate cache size for efficient data handling.\n\nOverall, the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` configuration is integral to the operation of the `SessionLocal` class, enabling it to effectively manage query results and enhance the user experience through optimized data access."

A larger cache can lead to faster data retrieval for frequently accessed queries, reducing response times and improving user experience. Conversely, a smaller cache may result in increased query execution times due to more frequent cache misses, leading to time-intensive operations. Therefore, variations in this configuration can cause substantial performance differences in the system."
