Specifically, it is checked within the `isEverything` method of an expression evaluation process, where it plays a critical role in controlling the behavior of the system when handling evaluatable expressions.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to enable or disable the optimization of subqueries that can be evaluated at runtime. When set to `true`, the system allows for optimizations that can enhance the efficiency of query evaluations involving subqueries. Conversely, if it is set to `false`, the system refrains from applying these optimizations, potentially leading to a more straightforward evaluation process.\n\n#### Key Components Involved:\n- **ExpressionVisitor**: This is a key component that traverses expressions and evaluates their properties. It interacts with the configuration by checking its state when the visitor type is `EVALUATABLE`.\n- **Session and Database Settings**: The configuration is accessed through the session's database settings, indicating that it is part of a broader settings framework that governs various operational parameters of the database.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\nThe configuration interacts primarily with the `ExpressionVisitor` during the evaluation of expressions. When the visitor type is `EVALUATABLE`, the configuration is checked to decide whether to proceed with optimizations. This interaction ensures that the evaluation logic can adapt based on the configuration, allowing for flexible handling of subqueries based on the system's current operational requirements.\n\nIn summary, `OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES` is a configuration that influences the evaluation strategy of subqueries within the database system, providing a mechanism to enable or disable optimizations based on the current settings defined in the database session."
