            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` setting can lead to significant performance variations because it forces the database statement to be re-compiled every time it is executed. This re-compilation process can be time-intensive, especially for complex queries or operations that involve substantial data manipulation, as it requires the database engine to analyze and optimize the execution plan anew. If this configuration is enabled unnecessarily, it can lead to excessive CPU usage and increased latency in query execution, impacting overall system performance."
