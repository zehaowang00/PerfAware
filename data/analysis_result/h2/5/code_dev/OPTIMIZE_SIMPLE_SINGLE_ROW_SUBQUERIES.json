It is checked to determine whether optimization can proceed.\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeSimpleSingleRowSubqueries` flag, which must be enabled for the optimization logic to execute.\n\n#### Interaction with Other System Components:\n1. **Query Preparation**: The method begins by preparing the query, ensuring it is ready for evaluation.\n2. **Conditional Optimization**: If the `outerResolvers` are present and the optimization setting is enabled, the method attempts to retrieve a single-row expression from the query.\n3. **Expression Evaluation**: The method checks if the retrieved expression meets certain criteria using `ExpressionVisitor`. If it does, the expression is further optimized.\n4. **Resetting State**: After processing, `outerResolvers` is reset to `null`, and the type of the current expression is set, ensuring that the state is clean for subsequent operations.\n\nIn summary, the `OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES` configuration facilitates targeted optimization of specific query patterns, relying on session context and database settings to determine when and how to apply these optimizations.
