This value defines the upper limit for the `queryTimeout` parameter that can be set by the user.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of this configuration is to ensure that the query timeout does not exceed a predefined maximum value, which is essential for maintaining system stability and preventing excessively long-running queries.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Validation**: When the `setQueryTimeout` method is called, it first checks the value of `maxQueryTimeout`. If this value is non-zero and less than the provided `queryTimeout` or if the provided `queryTimeout` is zero, it adjusts the `queryTimeout` to the maximum allowable value.\n   \n2. **State Management**: After setting the `queryTimeout`, the method resets the `cancelAtNs` variable to zero. This ensures that any previous cancellation timing is cleared, preventing unintended behavior from lingering state.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `database` object, specifically the `getSettings()` method, to retrieve the `maxQueryTimeout` value. This indicates a dependency on the database's configuration management system.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\n- The `setQueryTimeout` method interacts with other parts of the system that may rely on the `queryTimeout` value for executing database queries. By enforcing the maximum limit, it indirectly influences how queries are managed and executed throughout the application.\n\nThis configuration plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of query execution by enforcing limits based on system-defined settings, ensuring that the application behaves predictably under varying conditions."
