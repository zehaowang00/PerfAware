This decision is made based on the `dropRestrict` setting retrieved from the database settings.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- **Restrictive Action (`RESTRICT`)**: If `dropRestrict` is set to true, the system will prevent the drop operation if there are existing dependencies (constraints) that would be violated by the drop.\n- **Cascading Action (`CASCADE`)**: If `dropRestrict` is false, the system allows the drop operation to proceed, automatically removing any dependent constraints or objects.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **SessionLocal**: Represents the current session context, which is essential for accessing the database settings.\n- **Schema**: Represents the database schema context, which is relevant for operations that involve specific database objects.\n- **ConstraintActionType**: An enumeration that defines the types of actions (RESTRICT or CASCADE) that can be taken when dropping objects.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The `dropAction` variable is set based on the `dropRestrict` configuration, which is accessed through `session.getDatabase().getSettings()`. This establishes a direct dependency on the database settings, indicating that the behavior of drop operations is contingent on the configuration defined at the database level.\n- Each of the drop-related classes (e.g., `DropView`, `DropTable`, `DropDomain`, `DropSchema`, `AlterTableDropConstraint`) utilizes this configuration to determine how to handle the drop operation, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of database objects.\n\nIn summary, the `DROP_RESTRICT` configuration is integral to managing the integrity of database operations by controlling how dependencies are handled during drop actions, thereby influencing the overall behavior of the system in relation to database schema modifications."
