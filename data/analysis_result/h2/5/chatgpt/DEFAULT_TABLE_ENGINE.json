    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration in the H2 database significantly influences how data is stored and accessed, which directly affects query performance and memory usage. Different table engines can lead to variations in execution time due to differences in indexing strategies, data retrieval methods, and transaction handling. For instance, switching from a default table engine to a different one may optimize certain queries while degrading others, leading to notable variations in overall system performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on the performance of the database system."
