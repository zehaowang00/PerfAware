    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The REUSE_SPACE configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts memory management and allocation strategies. Changes to this setting can lead to variations in how memory is reused for object storage, which directly affects memory consumption and garbage collection behavior. A higher reuse space may reduce memory fragmentation and improve cache performance, leading to faster execution times, while a lower reuse space could increase memory overhead and slow down performance due to more frequent garbage collection cycles. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
