    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT' in the H2 database significantly impacts query execution performance. When enabled, it can lead to more efficient execution plans for SELECT statements, reducing execution time and resource consumption. Conversely, disabling this option may result in suboptimal query performance, leading to increased latency and higher memory usage due to less efficient data retrieval strategies. Therefore, changes to this configuration can notably affect overall system performance."
