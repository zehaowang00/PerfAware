    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance. When this option is enabled, the database engine optimizes the execution plan for queries that involve OR conditions, which can lead to reduced execution times and lower resource consumption. Conversely, if this option is disabled, the engine may choose a less efficient execution plan, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
