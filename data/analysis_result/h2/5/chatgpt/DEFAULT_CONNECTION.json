    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts system performance because it determines the number of concurrent connections that can be handled. A higher value can lead to increased resource consumption, such as memory and CPU usage, which can result in longer execution times if the system becomes overloaded. Conversely, a lower value may limit throughput and increase latency for user requests. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
