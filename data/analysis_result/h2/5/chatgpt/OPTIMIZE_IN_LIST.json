    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST' in the H2 database can significantly impact the performance of query execution, particularly in scenarios involving large datasets. When this option is enabled, the database engine optimizes operations involving lists, which can lead to reduced execution time and lower memory consumption during query processing. Conversely, disabling this option may result in less efficient query plans, leading to increased resource usage and slower performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
