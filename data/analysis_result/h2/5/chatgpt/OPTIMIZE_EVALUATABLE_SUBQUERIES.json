    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance. When enabled, it allows the database engine to optimize subqueries, which can lead to reduced execution time and lower memory consumption during complex query processing. Conversely, if disabled, the database may execute subqueries less efficiently, resulting in longer execution times and increased resource usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
