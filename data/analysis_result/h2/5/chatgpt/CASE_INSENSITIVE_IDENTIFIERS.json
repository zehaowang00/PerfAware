    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS' in the H2 database can significantly impact system performance. When enabled, the database must perform additional checks and transformations to handle identifier comparisons in a case-insensitive manner. This can lead to increased execution time for queries, particularly those involving joins or where clauses that utilize identifiers. Additionally, it may result in higher memory consumption due to the need for storing and processing identifiers in a normalized format. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in both execution time and resource usage, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
