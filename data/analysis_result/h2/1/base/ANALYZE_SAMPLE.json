This configuration specifically determines the sample size used during the analysis process.\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - The `analyzeSample` setting defines the number of rows that will be sampled from each table during the analysis. This helps in gathering statistics about the data distribution and optimizing query performance.\\n\\n2. **Functionality**:\\n   - During the initialization of the `Analyze` class, the `analyzeSample` value is retrieved from the database settings through the `getSettings()` method. This value is then assigned to the `sampleRows` variable.\\n   - The `analyzeTables` method utilizes this `analyzeSample` value to calculate `rowCount`, which is set to one-tenth of the `analyzeSample`. This calculated value is used when invoking the `analyzeTable` method for each table that needs to be analyzed.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The `analyzeSample` configuration is dependent on the `getSettings()` method of the database, which retrieves various settings, including the `analyzeSample` value. The retrieval process involves checking if connection information is already cached or if it needs to be loaded from properties.\\n\\n4. **Key Components**:\\n   - **SessionLocal**: The `Analyze` class is initialized with a `SessionLocal` object, which provides access to the database and its settings.\\n   - **Database Settings**: The settings are encapsulated within a settings object that includes the `analyzeSample` value.\\n   - **Tables and Analysis**: The configuration interacts with the `analyzeTables` method, which performs the actual analysis on the specified tables using the sample size defined by `analyzeSample`.\\n\\n5. **Interaction with Other Parts of the System**:\\n   - The `analyzeSample` configuration is integral to the analysis process, influencing how many rows are sampled from each table. This impacts the overall analysis conducted by the `analyzeTables` method and subsequently affects the database's performance and optimization strategies.\\n\\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is essential for determining the sampling size during table analysis, and it interacts closely with the database settings and the analysis methods within the `Analyze` class.\"}"

A larger sample size can lead to significantly longer execution times and increased memory usage, especially when analyzing large tables. This can result in performance variations that are substantial, as the analysis process may become time-intensive and memory-heavy depending on the size of the dataset being processed.
