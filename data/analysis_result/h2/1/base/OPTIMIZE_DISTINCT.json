Its primary purpose is to determine when to apply optimizations for queries that require unique results, ensuring that the execution plan is efficient based on the current query context.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n\n1. **Trigger Conditions**:\n   - The optimization is activated under specific conditions:\n     - The query is marked as `distinct`.\n     - The database settings permit distinct optimization, which is accessed via `session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeDistinct`.\n     - The query is not a group query.\n     - There is exactly one filter and one expression, with no additional conditions.\n\n2. **Expression Evaluation**:\n   - The configuration evaluates the first expression in the query to determine if it is an instance of `ExpressionColumn`. If so, it retrieves the associated column and assesses its selectivity.\n\n3. **Index Management**:\n   - The configuration interacts with the indexing system by checking if a suitable index exists for the column in question. If the selectivity of the column is below a defined threshold, the configuration attempts to select a more efficient index for the `topTableFilter`.\n\n4. **State Management**:\n   - The configuration maintains a flag, `isDistinctQuery`, which is set to true when a new index is established for the distinct query, indicating that the query has been optimized for uniqueness.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n\n- The `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration relies on the database session and its settings to determine whether optimizations can be applied. It interacts closely with the expression evaluation and indexing components of the system.\n- The method `getSettings()` is crucial as it retrieves the database settings that dictate whether distinct optimizations are permissible. This method has multiple overloads, each serving different purposes related to connection information and database settings.\n\nOverall, the `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration plays a vital role in managing how distinct queries are processed, ensuring that the system can effectively handle requests for unique results while leveraging available indexing strategies."

Its primary purpose is to determine when to apply optimizations for queries that require unique results, ensuring that the execution plan is efficient based on the current query context.\\n\\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\\n\\n1. **Trigger Conditions**:\\n   - The optimization is activated under specific conditions:\\n     - The query is marked as `distinct`.\\n     - The database settings permit distinct optimization, which is accessed via `session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeDistinct`.\\n     - The query is not a group query.\\n     - There is exactly one filter and one expression, with no additional conditions.\\n\\n2. **Expression Evaluation**:\\n   - The configuration evaluates the first expression in the query to determine if it is an instance of `ExpressionColumn`. If so, it retrieves the associated column and assesses its selectivity.\\n\\n3. **Index Management**:\\n   - The configuration interacts with the indexing system by checking if a suitable index exists for the column in question. If the selectivity of the column is below a defined threshold, the configuration attempts to select a more efficient index for the `topTableFilter`.\\n\\n4. **State Management**:\\n   - The configuration maintains a flag, `isDistinctQuery`, which is set to true when a new index is established for the distinct query, indicating that the query has been optimized for uniqueness.\\n\\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\\n\\n- The `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration relies on the database session and its settings to determine whether optimizations can be applied. It interacts closely with the expression evaluation and indexing components of the system.\\n- The method `getSettings()` is crucial as it retrieves the database settings that dictate whether distinct optimizations are permissible. This method has multiple overloads, each serving different purposes related to connection information and database settings.\\n\\nOverall, the `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration plays a vital role in managing how distinct queries are processed, ensuring that the system can effectively handle requests for unique results while leveraging available indexing strategies.\", \"Reminder\": \"This is a follow-up review.
