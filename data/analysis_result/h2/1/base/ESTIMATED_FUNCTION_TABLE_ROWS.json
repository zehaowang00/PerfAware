Its primary purpose is to provide an estimated number of rows for tables when an accurate row count cannot be obtained. This configuration is particularly relevant in scenarios where the database cannot directly retrieve the row count, allowing the system to maintain functionality and provide cost estimates for query planning.\n\n#### Key Components and Interactions:\n\n1. **Integration with `getCost` Method**:\n   - The configuration is accessed within the `getCost` method of a class, which calculates the cost of executing a query. If the method determines that the table can provide an accurate row count, it uses that value. However, if not, it falls back on the `estimatedFunctionTableRows` configuration to derive the expected number of rows.\n\n2. **Dependency on Database Settings**:\n   - The configuration is part of the broader database settings, which are managed by the `getSettings` methods. These methods retrieve various settings, including the `estimatedFunctionTableRows`, from the database's configuration management system.\n\n3. **Connection Information**:\n   - The configuration relies on connection information objects that are loaded from properties files or default values. This loading mechanism ensures that the settings are available for use in estimating row counts.\n\n4. **Fallback Mechanism**:\n   - The configuration acts as a fallback mechanism, ensuring that the system can still function and provide estimates even when direct access to row counts is not possible. This is crucial for maintaining query performance and planning.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is a vital configuration that enables the system to estimate query costs effectively, ensuring that it can operate smoothly even in the absence of precise row count data.
