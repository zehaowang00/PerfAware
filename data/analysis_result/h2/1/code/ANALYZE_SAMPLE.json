            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the number of rows processed during the analysis of tables, which can lead to significant variations in performance. The operation involves iterating through potentially large datasets, and the division of `analyzeSample` by 10 suggests that the sample size can still be substantial. If `analyzeSample` is set to a high value, it can lead to time-intensive operations, especially when analyzing multiple tables, thus impacting overall system performance significantly."
