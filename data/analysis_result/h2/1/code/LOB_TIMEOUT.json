            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration directly influences the duration of operations involving temporary result LOBs. The method `removeTemporaryLobs` utilizes this timeout to determine when to stop processing LOBs based on their creation time, which can lead to significant variations in performance. If the timeout is set too high, it may result in prolonged memory usage and processing time as more temporary LOBs are retained and processed, leading to potential memory exhaustion or delays in resource cleanup. Conversely, a low timeout could lead to premature removal of LOBs, affecting system functionality. Thus, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance due to its direct involvement in time-intensive operations."
