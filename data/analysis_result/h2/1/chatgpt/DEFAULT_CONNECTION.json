    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts system performance because it determines the number of concurrent connections allowed to the database. A higher number of connections can lead to increased resource consumption, including CPU and memory usage, which can affect overall execution time and responsiveness of the database under load. Conversely, a lower number of connections may lead to bottlenecks, causing delays in query execution and reduced throughput. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
