    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration in the H2 database affects how special characters are handled in SQL queries. Changes to this setting can lead to significant variations in how queries are executed, potentially impacting execution time and memory usage. For instance, if the escape character is altered, it may require additional processing to interpret the queries correctly, leading to increased execution times and memory overhead for parsing. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as its value change can notably affect system performance."
