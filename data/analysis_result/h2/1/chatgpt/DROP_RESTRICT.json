    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The 'DROP_RESTRICT' configuration in the H2 database affects how foreign key constraints are handled during drop operations. When set to restrict, the system must check for dependencies before allowing a drop, which can significantly increase execution time, especially in databases with complex relationships and large datasets. This added overhead can lead to notable variations in performance, particularly during schema changes or maintenance tasks, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
