    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration in the H2 database significantly affects how data is stored and accessed. Different table engines can lead to variations in execution time due to differences in indexing, locking mechanisms, and data retrieval methods. For instance, using a more efficient table engine can reduce the time taken for queries and improve overall throughput, while a less efficient one can lead to increased memory consumption and slower response times. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
