    "performance_sensitive": "No",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS' in the H2 database primarily affects how identifiers (like table names and column names) are treated in SQL queries. While this can influence the ease of use and the flexibility of query writing, it does not significantly impact the underlying execution time or memory consumption of the database operations themselves. The performance implications are minimal since the core operations of the database engine, such as data retrieval and manipulation, remain largely unchanged regardless of whether identifiers are case-sensitive or not. Therefore, changes to this configuration do not lead to notable variations in system performance."
