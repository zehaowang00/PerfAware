    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The REUSE_SPACE configuration in the H2 database affects how memory is allocated and reused during query execution and data storage. Changes to this configuration can lead to significant variations in memory consumption and garbage collection behavior, which in turn can impact execution time and overall system throughput. If REUSE_SPACE is set too low, it may lead to increased memory allocation and deallocation overhead, resulting in longer execution times. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to inefficient memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. Therefore, the value of REUSE_SPACE is critical to the performance of the system."
