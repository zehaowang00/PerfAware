    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance. When enabled, it optimizes the execution of single-row subqueries, which can lead to reduced execution time and lower resource consumption, especially in scenarios where such queries are prevalent. If the configuration is set to 'false' or not optimized, the database may resort to less efficient execution plans, resulting in longer execution times and increased memory usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
