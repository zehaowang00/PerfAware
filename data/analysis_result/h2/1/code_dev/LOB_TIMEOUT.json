Specifically, it defines the duration for which temporary result LOBs can exist before they are considered stale and eligible for removal. This configuration is accessed through the `database.getSettings().lobTimeout` method, which retrieves the timeout value in milliseconds.\n\n#### Key Components and Functionality:\n- **Temporary Result LOBs**: The method `removeTemporaryLobs` operates on a collection called `temporaryResultLobs`, which holds instances of `TimeoutValue`. Each `TimeoutValue` contains a timestamp indicating when the LOB was created.\n- **Time Calculation**: The method calculates a threshold time (`keepYoungerThan`) based on the current system time and the `LOB_TIMEOUT` value. This threshold determines whether a LOB should be retained or removed.\n- **Conditional Removal**: The removal process is conditional; if the `onTimeout` parameter is true and the creation time of the LOB exceeds the calculated threshold, the loop breaks, preventing further removals. Otherwise, LOBs that are not linked to any table are removed from the collection.\n\n#### Interactions with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `removeTemporaryLobs` method interacts with the `database` object to fetch the timeout setting, indicating a dependency on the database configuration.\n- The method also works closely with the `ValueLob` class, which represents the actual LOBs being managed. The interaction ensures that only unlinked LOBs are removed, maintaining data integrity within the system.\n\nIn summary, the `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration is essential for controlling the lifecycle of temporary LOBs, ensuring that outdated data is efficiently cleaned up while preserving relevant data linked to tables."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration directly influences the efficiency of memory management by determining how long temporary LOBs are retained in memory. If this timeout is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage as stale LOBs accumulate, potentially causing memory exhaustion or increased garbage collection overhead. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent removal of LOBs, which can be time-intensive if many LOBs need to be processed. The operations within the `removeTemporaryLobs` method, particularly the loop that processes `temporaryResultLobs`, can become time-consuming if the collection is large, thus significantly impacting overall system performance."
