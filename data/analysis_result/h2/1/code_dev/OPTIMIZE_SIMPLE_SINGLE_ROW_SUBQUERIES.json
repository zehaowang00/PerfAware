Its primary role is to determine whether specific queries can be optimized based on their structure and the presence of certain conditions.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **SessionLocal**: This object represents the current session and provides access to the database settings, including the `optimizeSimpleSingleRowSubqueries` flag.\n2. **Query**: The `query` object is central to the optimization process, as it prepares the query for evaluation and checks its characteristics.\n3. **Outer Resolvers**: This variable holds references that may influence the optimization logic. It is checked to determine if it is not null before proceeding with optimization.\n4. **Expression**: The `Expression` class represents the outcome of the optimization process. The method returns an optimized expression if applicable.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The configuration interacts with the database settings through `session.getDatabase().getSettings()`, specifically checking the `optimizeSimpleSingleRowSubqueries` setting to decide if optimization should occur.\n- The method `query.getIfSingleRow()` is called to retrieve a candidate expression for optimization, which is further evaluated to see if it meets the criteria for optimization.\n- The `ExpressionVisitor` is utilized to manage the query level during the optimization checks, ensuring that the correct context is maintained.\n\nIn summary, the `OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES` configuration plays a crucial role in determining the optimization path for queries that can be simplified, ensuring that the system can handle single-row subqueries more effectively based on the current session's settings and query structure."
