Its primary purpose is to enable specific optimizations for queries that require distinct results, ensuring that the query execution can be streamlined under certain conditions.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **Session and Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `session` object, which provides access to the current database context. It checks the `optimizeDistinct` setting from the database's configuration to decide whether to apply the optimization.\n  \n2. **Query Characteristics**: The configuration is activated when:\n   - The query is marked as `distinct`.\n   - It is not a group query (`!isGroupQuery`).\n   - There is only one filter (`filters.size() == 1`).\n   - There is only one expression in the query (`expressions.size() == 1`).\n   - There are no conditions present (`condition == null`).\n\n3. **Expression Handling**: The configuration specifically targets expressions that are instances of `ExpressionColumn`. It retrieves the underlying column and its selectivity, which is a measure of how many distinct values the column holds.\n\n4. **Index Utilization**: The configuration checks for an appropriate index on the column to enhance the query's execution. If a suitable index is found and meets certain criteria regarding selectivity, it sets this index on the `topTableFilter`, indicating that the query should utilize this index for execution.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration interacts closely with the query preparation process. It influences how the query planner decides to execute distinct queries by potentially altering which index is used based on the characteristics of the column involved.\n- By setting the index on the `topTableFilter`, it ensures that subsequent operations on this filter will leverage the optimized path for retrieving distinct results, thus integrating seamlessly into the overall query execution flow.\n\nIn summary, the `OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT` configuration is designed to enhance the handling of distinct queries by leveraging database settings, query characteristics, and indexing strategies, thereby facilitating more efficient query execution without delving into performance considerations."
