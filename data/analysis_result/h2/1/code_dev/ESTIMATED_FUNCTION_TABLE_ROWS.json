This configuration is utilized within the `getCost` method of a class that likely deals with query planning or cost estimation in a database context.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is to provide an estimated count of rows for tables that do not support direct row count retrieval. This is particularly relevant for virtual tables or scenarios where the actual row count cannot be determined efficiently.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- When the method `getCost` is invoked, it first checks if the table can provide an accurate row count using the `canGetRowCount(session)` method.\n- If the table can provide a count, it uses that value. However, if it cannot, the method defaults to using the `estimatedFunctionTableRows` configuration from the database settings.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is dependent on the broader database settings, specifically the `database.getSettings()` method, which retrieves the current configuration values.\n- **Table Interface**: The method relies on the `table` object, which must implement the ability to check for row count capabilities and provide an approximation if available.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Components:\n- The `getCost` method interacts with the `SessionLocal`, `TableFilter`, and `SortOrder` components, indicating that it is part of a larger query execution or planning process.\n- The use of `masks` and `filters` suggests that this configuration may play a role in determining the cost of executing specific queries based on their structure and the data they operate on.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is a crucial configuration that ensures the system can continue to function effectively by providing necessary estimates for row counts, thereby facilitating cost calculations in scenarios where direct counts are unavailable."
