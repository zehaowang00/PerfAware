The analysis process is contingent on this collection being non-null and the current thread holding a lock on the `Analyze` instance.\n\n#### Functionality and Interaction:\n- The `analyzeTables()` method utilizes the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration to determine the number of rows to sample for each table analysis. Specifically, it divides the `analyzeSample` value by 10 to set the `rowCount` for each table.\n- The method iterates over the `tablesToAnalyze` collection, invoking the `Analyze.analyzeTable()` method for each table, passing the calculated `rowCount`.\n- After the analysis, the method ensures that any locks held on the database metadata are released and commits any transactions that may have been opened during the analysis process.\n\nOverall, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is essential for defining the scope of data analysis, ensuring that a manageable subset of data is evaluated while maintaining the integrity and consistency of database operations."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly impacts the number of rows sampled during the analysis of database tables. A higher sample size can lead to significantly longer analysis times and increased memory usage, especially if the tables are large. Since the analysis process involves iterating over potentially numerous rows and performing operations that can lock database metadata, variations in the `analyzeSample` configuration can lead to substantial performance differences. This makes it a performance-sensitive configuration, as it can cause extremely time-consuming operations depending on the size of the dataset being analyzed."
