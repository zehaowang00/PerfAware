It is retrieved from the database settings through the method `database.getSettings().maxQueryTimeout`. This configuration ensures that any timeout value set for queries does not exceed the maximum allowed value defined in the database settings.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `database` object, which encapsulates the settings that include `maxQueryTimeout`.\n- **Query Timeout**: The `queryTimeout` variable is the primary component that is being set and validated against the maximum allowed value.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Validation**: When a new `queryTimeout` is provided, the method checks if it is greater than the `maxQueryTimeout` or if it is set to zero. If either condition is true, the `queryTimeout` is adjusted to the maximum allowed value.\n2. **State Management**: After setting the `queryTimeout`, the method resets the `cancelAtNs` variable to zero, ensuring that any previous cancellation state is cleared.\n\n#### Interaction:\nThis configuration interacts closely with the database settings and the overall query execution process. By enforcing a maximum timeout, it helps maintain consistency in how long queries are allowed to run, thus indirectly influencing how the system manages query execution and resource allocation.\n\nIn summary, the `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT` configuration is crucial for maintaining controlled query execution times, ensuring that timeout settings adhere to predefined limits set by the database configuration."
