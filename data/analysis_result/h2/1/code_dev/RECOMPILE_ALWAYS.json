This functionality is encapsulated in the `needRecompile()` method, which assesses various conditions to decide if recompilation is necessary.\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe primary purpose of the `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` configuration is to ensure that the database statements are up-to-date with the current state of the database. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of database operations, especially in dynamic environments where the database schema or data may change frequently.\n\n#### Key Components:\n1. **Database Instance**: The method retrieves the current `Database` instance from the session. If the database is not accessible (e.g., closed), it throws an exception, indicating a broken connection.\n2. **Modification Metadata**: The method compares the `modificationMetaId` of the current statement with the database's `modificationMetaId`. This comparison helps identify if any changes have occurred in the database that necessitate recompilation.\n3. **Settings**: The configuration interacts with the database settings through `db.getSettings().recompileAlways`. This setting can enforce recompilation regardless of other conditions.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `needRecompile()` method relies on the state of the `Database` object and its associated settings to determine recompilation needs.\n- It combines multiple conditions (`prepareAlways`, `modificationMetaId`, and `recompileAlways`) to provide a comprehensive check for recompilation, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered.\n\nIn summary, the `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` configuration is integral to maintaining the accuracy of database operations by ensuring that statements are recompiled when necessary, based on the current state of the database and its settings."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` configuration can lead to significant performance variations due to the potential for frequent recompilation of database statements. If recompilation occurs excessively, especially in a system with high transaction volumes or complex queries, it can result in time-intensive operations that degrade overall system performance. The need to recompile statements can consume CPU resources and increase latency, particularly if the recompilation logic is triggered often, making it a critical factor in performance-sensitive scenarios."
