This indicates that the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` is dependent on the overall database configuration, specifically the settings defined for caching behavior.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database**: The primary component from which the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` is derived. It encapsulates various settings that influence the session's behavior.\n- **Settings**: A sub-component of the `Database` that holds configuration parameters, including `queryCacheSize`.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` is utilized within the context of session management, specifically in how the `SessionLocal` class handles query execution and result caching.

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` directly influences how query results are stored and reused, which can lead to significant variations in performance. A larger cache size can improve query execution times by reducing the need for repeated database calls, especially in scenarios with high query repetition. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased memory usage and slower performance due to frequent cache misses and re-execution of queries. Therefore, this configuration has a substantial impact on system-level performance, making it performance sensitive."
