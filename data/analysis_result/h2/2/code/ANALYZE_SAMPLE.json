            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the number of rows processed during the analysis of tables, which can lead to significant performance variations. Specifically, the value of `analyzeSample` determines how many rows are sampled for analysis, and if this value is large, it can result in time-intensive operations as the system processes a greater volume of data. Since the analysis of tables can potentially involve heavy computation and memory usage, especially with large datasets, this configuration can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
