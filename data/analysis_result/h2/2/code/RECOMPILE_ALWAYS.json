If this flag is set, it may cause the system to recompile SQL statements every time they are executed, resulting in significant performance degradation, especially in scenarios with high execution frequency. This can lead to increased CPU usage and memory consumption due to the overhead of parsing and compiling SQL statements repeatedly, thus directly impacting system-level performance."
