    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' in the H2 database project directly influences how the database engine processes logical OR operations. When this option is enabled or disabled, it can lead to significant changes in the execution plan chosen by the query optimizer. This, in turn, can result in notable variations in execution time, especially for complex queries that involve multiple OR conditions. Additionally, the memory consumption may also be affected as different execution plans may require different amounts of resources. Therefore, changing the value of 'OPTIMIZE_OR' can have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
