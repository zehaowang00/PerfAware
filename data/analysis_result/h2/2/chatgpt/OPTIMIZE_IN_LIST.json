    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST' in the H2 database can significantly impact performance by altering how lists are processed during query execution. If this option is enabled, the system may optimize certain operations, leading to reduced execution time and lower memory consumption when handling large datasets. Conversely, disabling this option could result in less efficient query processing, causing notable increases in execution time and resource usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to substantial variations in overall system performance."
