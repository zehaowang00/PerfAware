    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration in the H2 database significantly influences how data is stored and accessed. Different table engines can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption due to differences in indexing strategies, data retrieval methods, and concurrency handling. For instance, switching from a default engine to a more optimized one can drastically reduce query response times and improve overall throughput, making this configuration critical for performance tuning."
