    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts system performance because it determines the number of concurrent connections that can be handled by the database. A higher value can lead to increased resource consumption, such as CPU and memory usage, which can affect overall system throughput and response times. Conversely, a lower value may restrict the number of simultaneous users, leading to potential bottlenecks and increased latency during peak loads. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
