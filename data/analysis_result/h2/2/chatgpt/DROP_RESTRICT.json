    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DROP_RESTRICT configuration in the H2 database affects how foreign key constraints are handled during drop operations. If set to true, dropping a table with foreign key constraints will fail, which can lead to increased execution time and complexity in managing database schema changes. Conversely, if set to false, it allows for quicker schema modifications, potentially reducing execution time significantly. This configuration directly impacts the performance of schema operations, making it performance-sensitive."
