    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The REUSE_SPACE configuration in the h2 database significantly impacts memory management and resource allocation. Changes to this configuration can lead to variations in how memory is reused during query execution and data storage. If REUSE_SPACE is set too low, it may result in increased memory consumption and longer execution times due to frequent garbage collection and memory allocation overhead. Conversely, setting it too high may lead to inefficient memory usage and potential memory leaks. Therefore, adjustments to this configuration can notably affect overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
