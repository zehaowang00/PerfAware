    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance. When enabled, it optimizes the evaluation of subqueries, which can lead to reduced execution time and lower memory consumption during complex query processing. Changes in this configuration can lead to variations in how subqueries are executed, potentially transforming them from inefficient nested queries into more efficient joins or other forms of execution plans. This optimization can drastically affect overall system performance, especially in scenarios with heavy query loads or complex data relationships."
