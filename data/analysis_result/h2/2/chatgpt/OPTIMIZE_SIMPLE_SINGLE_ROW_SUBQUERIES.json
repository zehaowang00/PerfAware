    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES' in the H2 database can significantly impact query execution performance. When enabled, it optimizes the execution of single-row subqueries, which can lead to reduced execution time and lower resource consumption during query processing. If this option is set to 'false' or not utilized, the database may resort to less efficient execution plans, resulting in longer execution times and increased memory usage. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
