    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS' in the H2 database can significantly impact system performance. When this option is enabled, the database must perform additional processing to handle identifier comparisons in a case-insensitive manner. This can lead to increased execution time for queries, especially in scenarios with a large number of identifiers or complex queries. Additionally, it may increase memory consumption due to the need for additional data structures to manage the case-insensitive comparisons. Therefore, changing this configuration can lead to notable variations in performance metrics."
