This configuration plays a crucial role in ensuring that the database statement reflects the most current state of the database, particularly after any modifications that could affect the execution plan.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Database Instance**: The method `needRecompile` retrieves the current `Database` instance from the session. If the database is not available (e.g., closed), an exception is thrown, indicating a broken connection.\n- **Modification Metadata**: The method checks the `modificationMetaId` against the database's current modification metadata. If the statement's metadata is outdated, it indicates that recompilation is necessary.\n- **Settings**: The configuration interacts with the `db.getSettings().recompileAlways` property, which directly influences the recompilation decision. If this setting is enabled, it will always return true, prompting recompilation regardless of other conditions.\n\n#### Interaction with Other System Parts:\nThe `needRecompile` method is called to assess whether the SQL statement should be recompiled before execution. It considers:\n- The `prepareAlways` flag, which, if true, forces recompilation.\n- The comparison of `modificationMetaId` with the database's current state to ensure that any changes are accounted for.\n- The `recompileAlways` setting, which can override other checks.\n\nThis configuration ensures that the execution of database statements is based on the most accurate and up-to-date information, thereby maintaining the integrity and correctness of database operations."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `RECOMPILE_ALWAYS` setting can lead to significant performance variations because it forces recompilation of database statements every time they are executed. This can result in time-intensive operations, especially in scenarios where statements are executed frequently. Frequent recompilation can consume considerable CPU resources and memory, particularly if the statements involve complex queries or large datasets. Therefore, this configuration directly impacts system-level performance due to the potential for increased execution time and resource consumption."
