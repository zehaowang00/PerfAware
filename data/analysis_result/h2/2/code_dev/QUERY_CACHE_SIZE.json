It is initialized in the `SessionLocal` constructor, where it is assigned the value obtained from the `database` object's settings. This indicates that the configuration is dependent on the `Database` class and its associated `Settings` object.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Database**: The `Database` instance provides access to various settings, including `queryCacheSize`. It acts as a central point for managing database-related configurations.\n- **Settings**: This component encapsulates various configuration parameters, including `queryCacheSize`, which directly influences the behavior of query caching.\n\n#### Functionality:\nThe `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` determines the maximum size of the cache used for storing query results. This allows the system to efficiently reuse previously executed queries, thereby potentially reducing the need for repeated database access. The configuration is essential for optimizing data retrieval processes, as it dictates how much memory can be allocated for caching query results.\n\n#### Interactions:\n- The `queryCacheSize` is set during the instantiation of `SessionLocal`, linking it directly to the lifecycle of a user session. This means that each session can operate with its own cache size based on the database configuration.\n- The configuration interacts with the database's query execution mechanism, influencing how queries are processed and stored.\n\nIn summary, the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` configuration is vital for defining the caching behavior of query results within the system, relying on the `Database` and `Settings` components to establish its value and functionality."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` directly influences the caching behavior of query results, which can significantly impact system performance. A larger cache size can reduce the frequency of database access for repeated queries, leading to substantial time savings in query execution, especially in scenarios with high query repetition. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased database load and slower response times due to more frequent cache misses. Therefore, this configuration can cause significant performance variations based on its value, classifying it as performance sensitive."
