            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration directly influences the performance of the system by determining how long temporary LOBs are retained before being removed. If the timeout is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory usage as unlinked LOBs accumulate, potentially causing memory exhaustion or increased garbage collection overhead. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent removals, impacting performance due to the overhead of managing these objects. The operations involved in checking and removing LOBs can be time-intensive, especially if the collection of temporary result LOBs is large, thus significantly affecting system performance."
