It is initialized in the `Analyze` class constructor, where it retrieves its value from the session's database settings. Specifically, `sampleRows` is set to the value of `analyzeSample`, which dictates the number of rows to be sampled during the analysis process.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n1. **SessionLocal**: This is the session object passed to the `Analyze` constructor, which provides access to the database and its settings.\n2. **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the database settings to obtain the `analyzeSample` value, indicating a direct dependency on the database's configuration management.\n3. **Tables to Analyze**: The `analyzeTables` method utilizes a collection of tables (`tablesToAnalyze`) that are marked for analysis. This collection is processed to perform the analysis on each table.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `analyzeTables` method checks if there are tables to analyze and if the current thread holds the necessary lock to proceed. This ensures thread safety during the analysis operation.\n- The method creates a local copy of the tables to analyze, which helps prevent issues that may arise from modifying the collection while iterating over it.\n- It calculates the number of rows to analyze by dividing the `analyzeSample` value by 10, which is then used in the `Analyze.analyzeTable` method for each table.\n- After the analysis is performed, the method unlocks the database metadata and commits any changes, indicating that the analysis may involve transaction management.\n\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is integral to the table analysis process, determining the sampling size and ensuring that the analysis is conducted in a controlled and thread-safe manner. Its interaction with session management and database settings highlights its importance in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the analysis operations within the system."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the number of rows sampled during the analysis of database tables. A higher sample size can lead to significantly longer execution times and increased memory usage, especially when analyzing large tables, which can impact overall system performance. The analysis process involves iterating over potentially large datasets and may open new transactions, making it critical to manage this configuration carefully to avoid performance degradation."
