As changes are made to the database, the `changesUntilAnalyze` counter is decremented, and when it reaches zero, it signals that an analysis should be performed. This mechanism ensures that the database remains efficient and up-to-date with its internal statistics without manual intervention.\n\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_AUTO` configuration plays a crucial role in automating database maintenance tasks, ensuring that the system can adapt to changes in data without requiring constant oversight from database administrators."

If analysis tasks are performed too frequently, they may consume considerable CPU and memory resources, leading to potential performance degradation. Conversely, if performed too infrequently, it may result in outdated statistics and inefficient query execution plans.
