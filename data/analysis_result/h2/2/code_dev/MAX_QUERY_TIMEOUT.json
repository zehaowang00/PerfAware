Its primary purpose is to ensure that any query timeout value set does not exceed a predefined maximum value retrieved from the database settings.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration relies on the `database.getSettings().maxQueryTimeout` method to obtain the maximum allowable query timeout. This indicates that the configuration is dependent on the database's settings component, which centralizes configuration management.\n- **Query Timeout Variable**: The `queryTimeout` variable is the main component being configured. It is set through the `setQueryTimeout` method, which adjusts its value based on the maximum limit defined by `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT`.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The method `setQueryTimeout` checks if the provided `queryTimeout` exceeds the maximum limit. If it does, or if the provided value is zero (which may indicate a reset or invalid input), the method adjusts the `queryTimeout` to the maximum value.\n- Additionally, the method resets the `cancelAtNs` variable to zero, ensuring that any previous cancellation settings are cleared when the timeout is updated. This indicates a direct interaction with the cancellation mechanism of the system, ensuring that it remains consistent with the newly set timeout.\n\nOverall, the `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT` configuration plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of timeout settings within the system, ensuring that they are kept within safe and predefined limits as dictated by the database's configuration."

While it ensures that timeouts do not exceed a certain threshold, the operations involved in checking and setting this value are not time-intensive or memory-intensive. The adjustments made in the `setQueryTimeout` method are lightweight and do not lead to significant performance variations, as they merely involve simple comparisons and assignments.
