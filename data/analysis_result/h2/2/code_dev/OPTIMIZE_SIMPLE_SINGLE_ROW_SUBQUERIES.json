It is central to the optimization process.\n- **Outer Resolvers**: This variable holds references to the outer query context, which is necessary for evaluating subqueries.\n- **Expression**: The `Expression` class represents the structure of a query or subquery and is used to encapsulate the logic for optimization.\n\n#### Functionality:\n1. **Preparation**: The method begins by preparing the query, ensuring it is ready for optimization.\n2. **Condition Check**: It checks if `outerResolvers` is not null and if the session's database settings allow for the optimization of simple single-row subqueries.\n3. **Single Row Evaluation**: If conditions are satisfied, it retrieves a potential single-row expression from the query. It further evaluates whether this expression meets specific criteria based on the outer resolvers.\n4. **Optimization Call**: If the expression is valid, it calls the `optimize` method on that expression, allowing it to be processed further.\n5. **Resetting State**: After the evaluation, `outerResolvers` is reset to null, and the type of the current expression is set before returning it.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThis configuration interacts closely with the database session and query execution components.
