This indicates that the configuration is dependent on the settings provided by the `Database` class.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n\n1. **Database Class**: The `SessionLocal` class relies on the `Database` instance to retrieve its configuration settings. This establishes a direct dependency on the `Database` class for the initialization of `queryCacheSize`.\n\n2. **Settings Retrieval**: The `getSettings()` method of the `Database` class is responsible for providing the necessary configuration values. It returns a list of connection info objects, which includes various settings such as `queryCacheSize`.\n\n3. **ConnectionInfo**: The `ConnectionInfo` objects are utilized to encapsulate the configuration details. The settings are loaded from properties, and if no properties are found, default values are generated.\n\n4. **Sorting of Settings**: The settings are sorted before being returned, ensuring a consistent order for any further processing that may depend on the configuration.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n\n- The `queryCacheSize` configuration directly influences how the system handles cached query results, potentially affecting the efficiency of query execution and resource utilization.\n- It is part of a broader set of database settings that include `queryTimeout` and `lockTimeout`, which are also initialized from the `Database` settings.
