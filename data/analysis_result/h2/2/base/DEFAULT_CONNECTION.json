It temporarily disables auto-commit mode to ensure that multiple operations can be executed as part of a single transaction.\\n\\n3. **Dynamic Connection Creation**:\\n   - If the `defaultConnection` is set to true, a new database connection is created using the `session.createConnection(columnList)` method. This connection is then set as the default for the `Driver`, allowing subsequent database operations to utilize this connection seamlessly.\\n\\n4. **Cleanup and Restoration**:\\n   - After the execution of the method, the configuration ensures that the default connection is reset to null, restoring the previous state of the connection settings.
