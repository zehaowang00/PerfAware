    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts performance because it determines how data is stored and accessed. Different table engines can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption due to differences in indexing, data retrieval methods, and transaction handling. For instance, using a more efficient table engine can reduce query execution time and lower memory usage, while a less efficient engine may lead to increased latency and resource consumption. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
