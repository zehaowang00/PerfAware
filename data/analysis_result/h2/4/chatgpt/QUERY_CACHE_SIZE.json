    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration in the H2 database significantly impacts performance because it directly affects how many query results can be cached in memory. A larger cache size can reduce the need for repeated query executions, leading to lower execution times and reduced memory consumption for repeated queries. Conversely, a smaller cache size may lead to increased disk I/O and longer execution times as queries are executed more frequently without cached results. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
