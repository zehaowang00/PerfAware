    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' in the H2 database project directly influences the execution strategy for logical OR operations. When this option is enabled or disabled, it can lead to significant changes in query execution plans, which may result in variations in execution time and resource utilization. For instance, optimizing OR conditions can reduce the number of rows processed and improve overall query performance, while not optimizing may lead to full table scans and increased memory consumption. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
