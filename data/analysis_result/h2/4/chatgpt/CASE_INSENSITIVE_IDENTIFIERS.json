    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The configuration option 'CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS' in the H2 database can significantly impact system performance. When this option is enabled, the database must perform additional checks and transformations to handle identifiers in a case-insensitive manner. This can lead to increased execution time for queries, as the database engine has to compare identifiers in a more complex way, potentially affecting indexing and lookup times. Additionally, memory consumption may increase due to the need for additional structures to manage case-insensitive identifiers. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in performance."
