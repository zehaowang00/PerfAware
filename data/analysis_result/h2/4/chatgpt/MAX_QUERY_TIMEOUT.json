    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration in the H2 database directly influences how long a query can run before it is terminated. If this value is set too high, it may lead to long-running queries that can consume excessive system resources, such as CPU and memory, potentially degrading overall system performance. Conversely, setting it too low may lead to premature termination of legitimate queries, which can also impact application performance negatively. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect execution time and resource utilization, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
