    "performance_sensitive": "Yes",
    "reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration in the H2 database significantly influences the number of concurrent connections that can be handled by the system. A change in this value can lead to variations in resource allocation, such as CPU and memory usage, which directly impacts the overall system performance. For instance, increasing the number of default connections can lead to higher contention for resources, resulting in increased execution time for queries and potential bottlenecks. Conversely, setting it too low may underutilize available resources, leading to suboptimal performance during peak loads. Therefore, this configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
