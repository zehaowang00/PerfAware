This helps prevent excessively long-running queries that could impact system stability and resource utilization.\n\n#### Functionality:\n- The method `setQueryTimeout(int queryTimeout)` retrieves the maximum query timeout value from the database settings through `database.getSettings().maxQueryTimeout`.\n- It checks if the retrieved maximum value (`max`) is non-zero and compares it with the provided `queryTimeout`. If the provided timeout exceeds the maximum or is set to zero, it adjusts `queryTimeout` to the maximum allowable value.\n- The adjusted or original `queryTimeout` is then assigned to the instance variable `this.queryTimeout`.\n- Additionally, the method resets the `cancelAtNs` variable to `0L`, ensuring that any previous cancellation settings are cleared.\n\n#### Dependencies and Interactions:\n- The configuration relies on the `database` object, specifically its `getSettings()` method, to access the `maxQueryTimeout` value.\n- The `queryTimeout` variable interacts with other components of the system that execute database queries, ensuring that all queries adhere to the defined timeout constraints.\n- This configuration indirectly influences the behavior of query execution and cancellation mechanisms within the database management layer.\n\nOverall, the `MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT` configuration is integral to maintaining control over query execution times, ensuring that they remain within acceptable limits as defined by the system's settings."
