This is controlled through the `dropAction` variable, which is set based on the value of `session.getDatabase().getSettings().dropRestrict`.\n\n#### Functionality\n- **Restrictive Action (`ConstraintActionType.RESTRICT`)**: If `dropRestrict` is true, the system will prevent the drop operation if there are any dependencies on the object being dropped. This ensures that the integrity of the database is maintained by not allowing the removal of objects that are still in use.\n  \n- **Cascading Action (`ConstraintActionType.CASCADE`)**: Conversely, if `dropRestrict` is false, the system will allow the drop operation to proceed and automatically remove any dependent objects. This can lead to the removal of multiple related objects in one operation.\n\n#### Key Components\n- **SessionLocal**: Represents the current session context, providing access to the database and its settings.\n- **Schema**: Represents the database schema within which the objects reside.\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is dependent on the settings retrieved from the database, specifically the `dropRestrict` property.\n\n#### Interactions\nThe `DROP_RESTRICT` configuration interacts with several classes responsible for different drop operations:\n- `DropView`\n- `DropTable`\n- `DropDomain`\n- `DropSchema`\n- `AlterTableDropConstraint`\n\nEach of these classes checks the `dropRestrict` setting to determine how to handle the drop operation. By centralizing this logic, the system ensures consistent behavior across different types of drop actions, allowing for a uniform approach to managing dependencies in the database.\n\nIn summary, the `DROP_RESTRICT` configuration is essential for managing the integrity of database operations by controlling how dependencies are handled during drop actions, ensuring that the system behaves predictably and maintains data integrity."
