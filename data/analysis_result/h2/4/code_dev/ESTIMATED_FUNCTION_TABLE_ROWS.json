This configuration is particularly relevant in scenarios where the table's structure or state does not allow for a precise count, such as with virtual tables.\n\n#### Purpose and Functionality:\n- **Fallback Estimation**: The primary purpose of `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` is to provide an estimated number of rows for cost calculations when the actual row count is unavailable. This is crucial for the system's ability to make informed decisions regarding query planning and execution.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **Database Settings**: The configuration is accessed via `database.getSettings()`, indicating that it is part of a broader settings management system within the database context.\n- **Session Context**: The method operates within a `SessionLocal` context, which suggests that the estimation may vary depending on the session's state or characteristics.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- **Cost Calculation**: The `getCost` method utilizes the `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` configuration to compute the expected cost of operations involving the table. If the system can retrieve the row count directly, it does so; otherwise, it resorts to the estimated value provided by this configuration.\n- **Error Handling**: The method includes a check for `masks`, throwing an exception if they are present, which indicates that the configuration is part of a larger validation and error-handling framework within the system.\n\nIn summary, `ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS` plays a critical role in ensuring that the system can maintain operational functionality and make estimations in the absence of direct data, thus supporting the overall query planning process."
