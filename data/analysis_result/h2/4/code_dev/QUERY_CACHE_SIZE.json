Its primary purpose is to define the size of the query cache, which is utilized to store the results of previously executed queries. This allows for quicker access to frequently requested data, thereby enhancing the efficiency of data retrieval operations.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- **Database**: The `SessionLocal` class has a direct dependency on the `Database` object, which provides access to the database settings. The `queryCacheSize` is fetched from the `getSettings()` method of the `Database` class.\n- **User**: The `User` object represents the user associated with the session, although it does not directly influence the `queryCacheSize`.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Settings**: The `Settings` class within the `Database` object contains various configuration parameters, including `queryCacheSize`. This encapsulation allows for centralized management of configuration settings related to database operations.\n- **SessionLocal**: This class encapsulates the session context for a user, including the configuration parameters necessary for managing queries effectively.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\nThe `queryCacheSize` interacts with the query execution process by determining how much data can be cached from previous queries. This interaction is crucial for optimizing the session's ability to handle repeated queries efficiently. The size of the cache can influence how many results are stored and how quickly they can be accessed, although the specific performance implications are outside the scope of this summary.\n\nIn summary, the `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` configuration plays a vital role in the `SessionLocal` class by facilitating efficient data retrieval through caching, relying on the `Database` and its settings for its value and functioning within the broader context of user session management."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` directly impacts the performance of query execution and data retrieval operations. A larger cache can significantly reduce the time taken to access frequently requested data, especially in systems with high query volumes or complex data retrieval patterns. Conversely, a small cache may lead to increased query execution times due to more frequent cache misses, resulting in the need to re-execute queries against the database. Therefore, variations in `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE` can lead to substantial performance differences, classifying it as performance-sensitive."
