            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `LOB_TIMEOUT` configuration directly influences the retention and removal of temporary LOBs, which can significantly impact memory usage and system performance. If the timeout is set too high, it can lead to excessive memory consumption due to the accumulation of temporary LOBs, potentially causing out-of-memory errors or degraded performance. Conversely, if set too low, it may lead to frequent and unnecessary removals, impacting processing time. The operations involved in checking and removing LOBs are time-intensive, especially when dealing with large collections, making this configuration critical for maintaining optimal performance levels in the system."
