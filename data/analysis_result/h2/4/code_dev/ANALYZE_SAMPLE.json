It is utilized to determine the number of sample rows that will be analyzed from the database tables. This configuration is accessed during the initialization of the `Analyze` class, where it retrieves the value from the session's database settings.\n\n#### Key Components and Dependencies:\n- **SessionLocal**: The `Analyze` constructor takes a `SessionLocal` object, which provides access to the current session's database context.\n- **Database Settings**: The `sampleRows` variable is assigned the value of `analyzeSample` from the database settings, indicating the number of rows to be sampled during the analysis.\n- **Tables to Analyze**: The `analyzeTables` method operates on a collection of tables (`tablesToAnalyze`) that are marked for analysis. This method uses the `sampleRows` value to determine how many rows to analyze for each table.\n\n#### Interaction with Other Parts of the System:\n- The `analyzeTables` method checks if there are tables to analyze and if the current thread holds a lock on the instance. If both conditions are met, it proceeds to create a local copy of the tables to analyze.\n- It calculates the `rowCount` for analysis by dividing the `analyzeSample` value by 10, ensuring that a manageable number of rows is processed.\n- The method iterates over the local copy of tables, invoking the `Analyze.analyzeTable` method for each table, passing the calculated `rowCount`.\n- After completing the analysis, it unlocks the database metadata and commits any changes made during the analysis process.\n\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is integral to the data analysis functionality, dictating how many rows are sampled from the database tables for analysis. It interacts closely with the session and database settings, ensuring that the analysis is performed correctly and efficiently within the system's architecture."

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the number of rows analyzed from the database tables, which can lead to significant variations in performance. If a large sample size is set, the analysis operation could become time-intensive and memory-heavy, especially when processing multiple tables concurrently. This can result in increased resource consumption and longer execution times, impacting overall system performance. The analysis process involves locking mechanisms and transaction management, further emphasizing the potential for performance degradation with larger sample sizes."
