While the timeout can influence the duration of query execution, the method itself does not perform any time-intensive or memory-intensive operations. The impact of changing the query timeout is generally moderate and does not directly lead to significant performance variations in the system, as it mainly affects how long a query can run before being canceled rather than the execution efficiency of the queries themselves."
