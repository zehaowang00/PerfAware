            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES` configuration directly influences the execution path of queries that can significantly affect performance. When enabled, it allows for optimizations that can reduce the complexity of query execution, particularly for subqueries that are expected to return a single row. This can lead to substantial time savings in scenarios where queries are executed frequently or involve large datasets. The presence of checks for `outerResolvers` and the optimization of single-row queries indicate that this configuration can lead to considerable performance variations, especially in memory and processing time during query execution."
