The justification highlights that optimizing these queries can significantly enhance overall query performance, reducing execution time and improving system efficiency. The explanation provided is comprehensive, addressing the critical role of this configuration in the query optimization process and its implications for performance in database operations. All relevant aspects of performance sensitivity have been thoroughly assessed and articulated."
