Here\\u2019s a breakdown of its purpose and interactions within the system:\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration defines the number of rows sampled during the analysis of database tables. This sample size is critical for optimizing the analysis process, allowing for efficient examination of data without the need to analyze entire tables.\\n\\n2. **Functionality**:\\n   - The configuration is accessed through the `getSettings()` method of the database session, which retrieves the current settings, including `analyzeSample`. This value is then utilized in the `analyzeTables()` method to determine how many rows to sample for each table being analyzed.\\n\\n3. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration depends on the `SessionLocal` object, which encapsulates the database connection and its settings. It also relies on the `getDatabase()` method to access the database settings.\\n\\n4. **Key Components**:\\n   - **Analyze Class**: This class is responsible for performing the analysis of database tables. It uses the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration to guide its operations.\\n   - **SessionLocal**: This object provides the context for the current database session and allows access to the settings.\\n   - **Database Settings**: The settings are encapsulated within the database object, which includes various configurations like `analyzeSample`.\\n\\n5. **Interactions**:\\n   - The `analyzeTables()` method utilizes the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` value to compute the number of rows to analyze for each table. It divides the sample size by ten to determine `rowCount`, which is then passed to the `analyzeTable()` method for processing.\\n   - The configuration interacts with other components of the system by influencing how data is sampled during analysis, thus affecting the overall behavior of the `Analyze` class.\\n\\nIn summary, the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration is integral to the functionality of the `Analyze` class, guiding how database tables are sampled during analysis and ensuring efficient data handling within the system.\"}"

            "content": "The configuration is Performance Sensitive: The `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` configuration directly influences the sample size used during the analysis of database tables. Since the analysis process can involve time-intensive operations, particularly when dealing with large datasets, the sample size can significantly affect the execution time and resource utilization. A larger sample size may lead to longer processing times and increased memory usage, especially if the analysis involves complex computations or large volumes of data. Thus, variations in the `ANALYZE_SAMPLE` setting can lead to substantial performance differences in the system."
